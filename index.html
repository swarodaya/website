                    <h3>Swar Yog</h3>
					<div class="text-left">
							<p class="text-muted"></p>
							<p class="text-muted"><p><p>Swaryog is an ancient indian science of breath awareness that has been practiced by yogis, spiritual masters, and seers of India, since thousands of years, to create a life of prosperity and abundance.Swar is breath and yog is to unite. Swaryog is a science where we unite with our breath to gain an understanding of the self and our universe. Swar or breath can be understood in terms of Nadis and Tatwas. When the breath flows from the left nostril, it is referred as the Chandra Swar and is associated with the Ida nadi of our body. When the breath flows from the right nostril, it is referred as the Surya Swar and is associated with the Pingala Nadi of our body. When the breath flows from both nostrils, at once, it is referred as the Shunya Swar and is connected with the Sushumna nadi of our body. The breath, depending on the flow is associated with the different nadis, which in turn, has different effects on our mind and body. To add to the effect of these nadis, is the dimension of ‘tatwas’ or elements. The place in the nostril through which the breath flows, is referred to as the ‘element’ or ‘tatwa’ of the breath. There are five different elements (Space, Air, Fire, Earth, and Water) that can flow in a nostril at a given time. This combined play of Nadis and Tatwas is the science of Swaryog. It not only helps you raise your awareness and connect deeply within, and feel grounded and rooted, but also is of immense help in decision making, event planning, foreseeing events, creating abundance and prosperity. During the session, students learn to recognize the Nadis, the Tatwas and understand their properties and usage for their personal and professional use.<p> <br> The Swaryog session covers: <ul> <li> An in-depth understanding of the Nadis and Tatwas. This includes the Nadis and Tatwa identification, and their practical usage in terms of understanding your own mind and emotions based on your own Swar, working through your own challenges and gaining clarity, making major and minor life decisions and creating a contented life. <li> Swar Panchang - Planning events (wedding, meetings, interviews etc) based on the knowledge of Swar. <li> Association of Swar with other occult sciences like Astrology and Vastu.</p>

                    <h3>The Yog Sutras of Patanjali</h3>
					<div class="text-left">
							<p class="text-muted"></p>
							<p class="text-muted"><p><p>The Yog Sutras were codified by Sage Patanjali about 5000 years ago in Sanskrit. The sutras, 196 in number and divided into 4 Padas or chapters, deals in depth with subjects like Samadhi and its forms, Sadhana and its various methods, Siddhis - their attainments and results, and Kaivalya - the science and art of being in Flow. The popular Ashtang Yog form the core of these Sutras. The aim of the Yog Sutras is to help an individual attain immense clarity about the self, life, people and situations, giving a framework and structure to daily living. It is a guide to raising potential to the maximum and living life to the fullest, maintaining calm and composure even in stressful situations. The Yog Sutras helps us identify, and then plug, our energy leakages on mental and physical level, helping us evolve, be efficient, better organized and gain inner strength.<p>  <br> During the course, Seema Karecha renders her understanding of these complex sutras in simple english and helps the student grasp their crux and make use of the understanding to simplify and enhance life.<p> <br> Through these sutras, you will receive the vedic wisdom on - <p> <li> How to resolve conflicts of your own mind, and bring it to a steady, stable and a healthy state. <li> Discover and then connect with the ISHWAR TATWA within. <li> Make life more meaningful and contented.</p>

					<div class="text-left">
							<p class="text-muted"></p>
							<p class="text-muted"><p><p>Many of us meditate - or have at least tried to meditate - but may not have found the results satisfactory. Many a times, when we sit to meditate, we end up closing our eyes and lose ourselves in thoughts, and fail to get the desired benefits. There are special techniques that must be followed to experience deep meditative states. At Swarodaya, students are beautifully guided through thoughtfully designed techniques to bring in a state where they are actually able to immerse themselves in the state of deep meditation. The specially designed meditative techniques help one expand the threshold of awareness leading one towards more insightful and enlightened living. <p> <br> The meditation sessions include : <li> Tatwa Meditations. <li> Sushumna Meditation. <li> Devi Meditation (an ancient meditation, that help you emerge emotionally and spiritually uplifted after the process. It is an extremely deep and cleansing process that balances the inner and the outer being).</p>

						The seventh energy field from the eastern direction is Bhrisha.
Zone: ESE
Significance of Bhrisha:
Samudra manthan (समुद्रमन्थन) &ndash; churning of the ocean &ndash; is one of the most famous events in the hindu mythology, and is the attribute of this energy field.
Once the Devtas were defeated by the Demons, to figure a way out, the Devtas sought help from the Lord Vishnu who advised them to handle the matter tactfully.
