Swar is breath and yog is to unite. Swar Yog is the science of breath awareness where we observe and analyse our own breath, to make sense of ourselves, our lives and our surroundings. Swar Yog sciences interpret breath on the dimensions of Nadis (the particular nostril from which the breath flow is on) and Tatwas (the exact place in the nostril from where it flows freely).</p><p>Learning the sacred science of Swar Yog, will help you gain an in-depth understanding (theoretical and practical) of Nadis and Tatwas. It will help you:<ul><li>Make meaningful life decisions to create prosperity and abundance</li><li>Manage emotions and health better</li><li>Plan all your major and minor activities as per the flow of Swar</li><li>Correlate Vastu and Astrology with the science of Swar Yog</li><li>Receive some special swar meditations and techniques to help you expand the threshold of your awareness and lead an insightful life.</li></ul></p>

                        <p><p>Manifestation is a three step process - of Thought, Words, and Action. First, a thought is conceived on the mind level, then it is expressed through words, and then energy is focussed towards execution. Every step is important. If there is no clarity of thought and the ideas are muddled, expressions will not be clear, and if the expressions are not clear then actions cannot be goal oriented. And when there is not enough focus towards action, there is no result! Each level is important and vital in the process of manifestation, for whenever there is harmony and alignment between what you feel, what you express, and what you do, only then will you reach and experience your desired outcome.</p><p>Saraswati Sadhana is a sadhana that helps you on each level, with special emphasis on activating your power of speech. Learning this sadhana will empower you with special vedic techniques that will help you:</p><ul><li>Gain clarity of thought.</li><li>Gain ability to express yourself clearly, with confidence and ease.</li><li>Channel your energy in your desired actions.</li></ul><p>Once you are initiated into this sadhana and you practice it on a regular basis, you will:</p><ul><li>See your thoughts gain clarity, your speach become meaningful, and you gain focus (confusion goes away) in your tasks.</li><li>As a business person and a professional, your ability to convey your ideas to your clients will increase many fold.</li><li>As a student, your ability to understand your subject and retain your knowledge will improve immensely</li><li>As a consultant, you will see your intelligence and insights increase many fold.</li><li>In your day to day dealings, people will take you seriously and want to listen when you talk.</li><li>You will see that your focus will increase many fold and you will be able to channel your energy towards your tasks.</li></ul><p>This Sadhana is of immense help to students, even children, in so many ways. With prolonged practice, they will see a substantial difference in their ability to think, express and focus better.</p></p>
