                                <p>Yog Sutra 1.48 to 1.51</p>

<p>Seedless, higher-state samadhi.</p>

<p>In these last sutras of the first pad, Patanjali takes us to the deeper realms of the subconscious through the practice of intuition. These states are of the higher, seedless-samadhi; the regular practice of which is very important for us to know and realize the purpose of our life. Just like success, samadhi is not a destination. It is journey - the difference is that instead of travelling on rugged and rough, directionless and maze-like roads, the journey is pre-decided, aware and meaningful, in the right direction, on the correct speed, and on the karma-marga (the path of action), taking life to higher levels.</p>

<p>In continuation of the past sutras, Patanjali says that &lsquo;adhyatma prasad&rsquo; - (our desires and wishes based on the awareness of our capabilities, and strengths) - imparts us with total wisdom. As we understood - &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo; in the past sutras - it is the knowledge arising from deep within, which was not present previously, but has risen for the attainment of our intentions. Patanjali talks about one more aspect of this wisdom - one that is complete with the truth, which can be tested in the practical world, as the knowledge that has meaningful practical applications. The knowledge that cannot be tested, that is not useful towards the attainment of the purpose, the existence or non-existence of that knowledge does not matter. One that is the truth, has an use, and based on the utility of which, all the meaningful discoveries have been made; new discoveries, new inventions, which are practical and useful and the one that gives meaning to life. For success in life, your discoveries, our truth, will build higher pathways for us. Every individual is different. Everyone has their own style of working, after having awareness about ourselves - our approach, our way of working, our method - start to develop and and the awareness of which is the truth filled wisdom.</p>

<p>It would be very different from the knowledge that has been acquired in the past - through seen and heard mediums, and in itself holds a distinct meaning. For whatever you have understood and known earlier, this would be different from it. Since childhood, the religious views and environment of our home, observation of the social norms, education, exposure - all together form our identity. These form impressions and in day-to-day life, form our conditioning. We are made up of these impressions, and live by this identity.</p>

<p>Whenever in life, when we want to explore new heights or new successes, at that time, we need new impressions and reference points. From where do we get them? The world is limited. At that time, the wisdom obtained through spiritual offeractory, for the attainment of our goals, opens up new dimensions and new pathways. Then new ways, new thinking, new discoveries, drives us to new heights.</p>

<p>This state, helps us to create a new world and new impressions, bringing the previous ones to a halt. Then we no longer operate on the old impressions and references. Just like a snake sheds its skin to move ahead, we too, leave the old unwanted thinking and move ahead, completing one‚Äôs purpose, and attaining the desired results. When the new impressions gained from the new thinking are removed, and the old impressions are removed too, it creates a new state of seedless samadhi. A state filled with intense deep satisfaction - meaningful with our being, blissful and a state of self-absorption - the state of seedless samadhi.</p>

<p>End of Chapter Nine.</p>

<p>With this chapter, the translation of the book - &lsquo;Dhyan&rsquo;, comes to an end. For many, this would be the end of the yoga sutra journey, but for me, it marks a new beginning - new and a better understanding of the self and life. Thank you once again, GuruSakha. And a thank you to the reader for being co-travellers of this journey.</p>

<p>Gratitude to Guru Sakha. üôè<br />
Gratitude to you, the reader. üôè</p>

<p>Acharya Seema Karecha.</p>
