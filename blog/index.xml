      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yog Sutra: Chapter 1.1 to 1.4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yog means &amp;ndash; to stay within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thought patterns recur continuously in one&amp;rsquo;s subconscious. For example, if you had an argument with someone during the day, then just before bedtime the entire sequence of events replays on your mind just like a movie. Even though you do not wish to think about it, these thoughts continuously surface in your mind. For example, thoughts like  ‚Äúhe should not have said this‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI should have said that‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI too tried to explain saying this‚Äù, or ‚Äúwhy is he saying this?‚Äù, or ‚Äúhe should understand‚Äù, or ‚Äúwhy is he unable to see‚Äù etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recurring thoughts can start to play on your mind at anytime. They may play on your mind like a movie when you are brushing your teeth, or when you bathe, or when you are looking out of the window while driving, and at times when you are engrossed in work. If this flow of thoughts overwhelm you, you may not be able to continue to work. Most people tend to leave their work aside and get lost in these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patanjali says that only by subduing these thoughts, one is able to unite with the self, and that is the definition of Yog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only then is one able to stay within himself. He is united with the self. Until then, he tends to be like his recurring thoughts, where he is always lost in the flow of thoughts and loses his individuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one who is able to see this &amp;ndash; you, the self &amp;ndash; is termed as the ‚Äúobserver‚Äù by Patanjali. Just like an observer watching a movie. While listening to melodious songs, an observer tends to substitute himself in the scenes, and starts to dance with the on-screen character. He does this in the cinema hall as well as outside the cinema hall! While watching a movie, a certain impression is formed in the mind of the observer. And when that tends to recur, the observer tends to identify with the movie characters and in doing so, loses his individuality. He becomes like his recurring thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find many a people around you who live the lives of the characters they see in movies. They live the movie character not only while dancing, but also in behaviour, speech, thoughts, and in action too. This makes them lose their identity, and they expect others to treat them as the character that they are living in their minds. When people around them are unaware of the movie impressions, and have not seen the movie, and their behaviour is not as per the expectation, it gives rise to a new set of problems and pains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times when a person has lost his individuality, the methods of Yog can help one observe oneself, which in absence of a Yogic perspective would be difficult to observe. All achievements in life are possible only when one has identified with the self. When one fails to achieve the desired expectations in life, it indicates an absence of identifying with the self &amp;ndash; even if at a subtle level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further on, Patanjali discusses these subtle aspects. When you read about it, you realise that you live with these aspects several times a day. And to overcome them, Patanjali addresses the reason behind the continuous recurrence of thoughts, and then guides us with the techniques to stay within one‚Äôs self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gratitude to Guru Sakha. üôè&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Dhyan: Introduction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some events change the course of your life in a subtle, yet profound way. For me, one such event of life was being introduced to Patanjali Yog Sutras. During the preparation of the Advance Mahavastu course, KB sir entrusted me with the English translation of Patanjali Yog Sutras. Although it was a mammoth task and took a couple of months to translate, I enjoyed the journey. It helped me understand better the human mind and its workings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patanjali Yog Sutras are aphorisms by Sage Patanjali written circa 400 CE. They rank among the basic philosophical writings of yoga which talk about the methods of self realization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yog Sutras are divided into four chapters, containing in all 196 aphorisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 1: Samadhi pada. In this chapter, Patanjali describes Yog and the ways to attain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2: Sadhana Pada. In this chapter, Patanjali shares the instructions for the practice of Yog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3: Vibhuti Pada. Vibhuti is the Sanskrit word for &amp;ldquo;power&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;manifestation&amp;rdquo;. This chapter is about the powers that can be acquired by the practice of yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4: Kaivalya Pada. Kaivalya translates to &amp;ldquo;being in Rhythm&amp;rdquo;, which is the ultimate goal of yoga. This chapter describes the process of Kaivalya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a series of nine writings, I attempt to translate the book Dhyaan &amp;ndash; by sir &amp;ndash; which describes the first chapter, &amp;ldquo;Samadhi Pada&amp;rdquo; in depth. Through easy to understand examples and lucid flow of words, this book is recommended reading to all those who wish to understand the essence of Yog sutras. This book is available in Hindi. I share the English translation of the same. In my translations, I have attempted to maintain the essence as I have felt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow along, you can get a copy of the book here at Amazon: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.in/Dhyan-Kya-Kyo-Aur-Kaise/dp/B0075LRW62&#34;&gt;http://www.amazon.in/Dhyan-Kya-Kyo-Aur-Kaise/dp/B0075LRW62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gratitude to Guru Sakha. üôè&lt;br /&gt;
Gratitude to you, the reader.üôè&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 16</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra16/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tat param purusha khyateh guna vaitrshnyam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest, most excellent supreme perception of pure soul awareness is achieved by trancending the three qualities of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patanjali states, that we shall be able to gain vision of the self, our true nature, of what we actually are, the (purusha), when we are able to curb the desires arising from the three gunas, the satwa, the rajas and the tamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of tri-gunas has originated from Samkhya philosophy, The closest English translation of this word is ‚Äúquality‚Äù. Sankhaya philosophy states that there are three gu·πáas, in every aspect of life, in every thought, in every action, These three gunas are sattva (good and constructive), rajas (passionate and active), and tamas (dark and destructive,). All of these three gunas are present in everyone of us and everything we do. The interplay of these gunas defines our character, It translates into our personality, innate nature, our behavior, our actions and our reactions. Our mind is always present in any one of the three gunas. We are living our lives in one of these three states all the time. And no personality or event is exclusisvly belongs to just one of the three gunas. However, when the ssattva guna is prominant, there is love and harmony, when the rajas guna is prominant, there is passion and activity, and when the tamas guna is prominant, there is intertia and lethargy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a mother, when I am teaching my children so that they are able to understand a subject well, learn it well and get a grasp over it, I am living in a sattvic state of mind. As the same mother, when I am encouraging them for activities and competion, when I am teaching them how to write the exam papers in the smartest possible way, when I am teaching them the little tricks and tips to get good grades, I am living in a rajasic state of mind. And as the same mother, when I am scolding them as they did not stand first in their class or they did not score as per my expectations, and I am disturbed and depressed, I am living in a tamasic state of mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I will influence the personality of my kids accordingly to the guna that is the most dominant in me through out the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is more of sattva guna in my nature, my children will grow up secure, balanced, stable, fearless and natural. As a mother, if I live more in the rajasic mode , my children will grow up to become competative, risk takers, adventurous and aggressive. And, as a mother, if I have a lot of tamas guna dominant in me, I will raise me children to be dependent, attention and approval seeking, distressed and having low levels of energy. I am the same mother, who lives in different states of gunas at different times of the day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patanjali says only when we are able transcend the desires that arise from the three gunas, we shall be able to know our true self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tat param purusha khyateh guna vaitrshnyam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest, most excellent supreme perception of pure soul awareness is achieved by trancending the three qualities of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 14</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra14/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sah tu dirgha kala nairantaira satkara asevitah dridha bhumih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistent and continues practice, with devotion, establishes a firm foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After explaining the importance of unbiased practice, for controlling the fluctuations of the mind, Patanjali states that continuous practice with effort and devotion, is the way to establishes a firm rooted foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book Outliers, author Malcolm Gladwell, says that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. After studying the lives of extremely successful people to find out how they achieved succes, the psychologists found a direct relationship between hours of practice and achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. But many of us dont know that Gates and Allen had done thousands of hours of programming practice prior to the founding of Microsoft. The Beatles, for years, played eight hours per night, seven nights per week. The Beatles had played over 1,200 concerts together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plain words, Patanjali is asking us to fall in love with our interests and living it 24x7! People who are sucessful in any fied, are not always born gifted. But they are in love with what ever they are doing and live their subject all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we start living a subject, we see start seeing patterns in it. We start seeing clues everywhere and it seems that the entire universe comes to help us achieve our goal. We start seeing twists and turns in it that were hiding in plain sight. Those revaltions of the subject come to us, which were otherwise impossible to grasp. All this and much more. Everything else stops to matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the next time, when we see someone doing something, that we think is amazing, and get a feel that we are not able to it, stop for a moment, and ask, whether is that person doing something that we are not? And if we, too, want to do the same. are we putting enough of hard work? Are we in love with the subject? Are we living it 24x7? Has it become our passion, our obsession?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apne aap se puchiye, kya apme woh junnon hai?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,
&lt;em&gt;sah tu dirgha kala nairantaira satkara asevitah dridha bhumih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistent and continous practice, with devotion, establishes a firm foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 13</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra13/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tatra sthitau yatnah abhyasa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A practice, which is a deliberate effort to bring stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stating in the previous sutras that continuous unbiased practice, is the way to control the thought whirls, in this sutra, Patanjali explains that deliberate practice of doing so, shall result into a stable mind. Here, Abhyasa refers, not just to mechanical efforts. It is an effort with your complete head and heart are involved. And it is done to such an extent, where it comes to a state where it gets effortless. And when we are able to do it effortlessly, it results into that state of mind, where the mind is at peace and is free from fluctuations and disturbances. It results into a stable mind. And only a stable mind will be able to find solutions from the sub-conscious! Only a stable mind is capable of those observations which we fail to perceive in normal day to day situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Steve Jobs once commented to his biographer,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIf you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is if you try to calm it, it only makes things worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there‚Äôs room to hear more subtle things - that‚Äôs when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It‚Äôs a discipline; you have to practice it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing a popular story of General Motors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, the Pontiac Division of General Motors received a complaint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our family, we have a tradition of having ice cream for desert after dinner each night. Every night, after we‚Äôve eaten, whenever I drive down to our local store to buy icecream and choose to buy Vanilla flavor, my car does not start! But if I buy some other flavor, it works fine!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However insane it sounded, the engineer arranged to meet the man just after dinner time ‚Äì and the two drove to the ice cream store ever night. On the days, they decided to order vanilla, the car would not restart, or else, everything would be just fine..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engineer now realised that there was a problem that needed identification and fixing. He started to log what happened from the moment they arrived at the store ‚Äì arrival time, time taken to make the purchase, and several other factors. Soon he had a clue ‚Äì purchases of vanilla ice cream took less time than the other flavours. The reason was that the freezer containing vanilla ice cream was at the front of the store near a quick purchase till, while other flavours were at the back and required lining up to get checked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly the engineer realised that this was the answer to the problem ‚Äì not the ice cream flavour, but the time required. When purchasing vanilla ice cream there was a vapour lock which prevented the car restarting. With the other flavours, there was sufficient time for the engine to cool down, allowing vapour to dissipate and the car to restart‚Ä¶.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Patanjali says, only and only, if you are capable of observation, you would be able to see situations from a different angle, and only and only, if you are able to see things differently, you will be capable of bring better solutions to them and create a better life for your self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tatra sthitau yatnah abhyasa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A practice, which is a deliberate effort to bring stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 12</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra12/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;abhyasa vairagyabhyam tat nirodhah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These can be stopped by unbiased practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After explaining the five reasons for thought whirls, Patanjali shares the method to stop them. He suggests unbiased practice. He uses the term abhyasa and vairagya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abhyasa is when something is done with persistent effort for a long time. After long term practise, the activity gets effortless and with passing time, the individual is able to perform it with excellence and ease. With repetition, the performance of a task comes naturally to a person and one is able to reproduce it with excellence from time to time. It becomes his second nature. This is Abhyasa. When practicing, or while doing Abhyasa, he asks the practitioner observe Vajragya, remain non-biased or non-attached. Non-attachment or non-biasedness to external factors, to the various aspects where Abhyasa is involved. Becoming non-attached to all those factors that may cause of the Abhyasa, practice to break, or be disturbed, that may result in imperfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between Abhyasa and Vajragya is that the Abhyasa, is an inward journey, while Vajragya, is cutting out the external distractions to make that inward journey smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets understand this with an example of a sport person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a child enrols in a sports academy, he is asked to continues practice for hours. Starting from how to hold a bat, or a ball, or how to lay the stumps in the ground. The student is asked to follow a set of fixed instructions while practicing. And in this process, after practicing for months and years, the student transforms into an ace cricketer and and starts playing the game very well, in a very unique way. This is, what we call Abhyasa, practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the same student, who is now a famous cricketer, while playing a match, focusses less on the game, and more on the photographers clicking his picture, or on the amount of media coverage he is getting, or on the prize money, then he is no longer unbiased. His attention is not longer just focused on the game. It has digressed to various external factors of the game and he has lost his internal focus. He has formed an attachment and his abhyasa is no longer vairagya ‚Ä¶.no longer unbiased. And from here, stems all kind of hurtful or non-hurtful thought whirls. Although he shall continue to play for years to come, his performance shall sway as per his thought whirls, for whenever he would need to pay his peak attention on the game, he may or may not be able to do so, as his mind would be focused on various external issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, Patanjali, requests unbiased practice, if we want to bring an end to continuous thought whirls, and bring in the stability to the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;abhyasa vairagyabhyam tat nirodhah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These can be stopped by unbiased practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;anubhuta vishaya asampramoshah smritih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past remembrances are based on our inability to let go experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patanjali states, that our past remembrances or memories, whether painful or not, whether hurtful or not, become the last reason to our non-stop, unending thought whirls. Memories, whether good or bad, become the foundation to our feelings and this foundation, forms our mind-set. Whatever we experiance gets permanently recorded in our minds, and as per the context, this recording starts playing. And all reactions, our responses are based on this recording. When this recording is repeated several times, it gets embedded in our behaviour, and we come to know it as our Sanskars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to our example of a boy meeting a girl at the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She is wearing a pink dress. She looks at him and smiles. In the past, the boy has fond memories of a meeting a girl, in a wedding, who was wearing a pink dress. In the past, that girl had falling in love with him and he had an pleasent affair. So, this time, again, when he sees a girl, at the wedding, in a pink dress, he thinks, he has found his beloved. But then, over a period of time, he realises, this is not the fact, and hence, he is lost in thoughts, he is in pain. In this case, his inability to let-go the memory of the past, becomes the cause for his pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time, we take a decision, we base the decision on our past. If our experiences in the past, in a particular context, have been pleasant, then we would want to continue that pleasent experiances, we would want to continue that feeling to be with us, and hence, we would choose accordingly. And if our experiences are negative, to avoid the pain, we would choose accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time, the details of our memories are erased and what remains with us, is the feel. And it is this feel gives birth to a series of hurtful or non-hurtful thought chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is about letting go the past, and moving on. It does not mean forgetting or forgiving everyone and every deed. Nor it means to clinging to every event or experience that has caused us happiness or pain. It is just means protecting ourselves from being stuck. We all have limited energy and time with us. It just means we need to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;anubhuta vishaya asampramoshah smritih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past remembrances are based on our inability to let go experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;abhava pratyaya alambana vritti nidra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repetitive unawareness is based upon lack of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sutra, Patanjali states nindra as the fourth reason for hurtful or not hurtful thought whirls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nindra, our unawareness. Patanjali does not refer to it to sleep with closed eyes. He refers to that state of mind, that we live in 24x7, with our open eyes. It refers to a state, where, with open eyes, we are unable to see, observe or perceive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to our example of a boy meeting a girl:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She looks at him, smiles. She starts a conversation with him and gives subtle suggestions about her interest in him. This boy however, is so full of himself, that he is totally unaware of the feelings, the girl is trying to communicate through her gestures. After the wedding is over, he realizes situation.. He realises what he had missed, as he he was unaware at that moment. But now, the moment has passed and it‚Äôs too late. Although, now, he is cannot stop thinking about what had happened. His unawareness becomes the foundation to his non-stop thought whirls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story can have two endings. In future, if he gets a chance to meet the girl, and convey his thoughts, he shall be happy. But if he does not get this opportunity, he shall be depressed. In whichever case, he is unable to stop thinking of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awareness is the ability to perceive, to feel, or to be conscious of events, objects, thoughts, emotions, or sensory patterns. And the level of awareness is directly linked to our success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Expanded awareness brings success. Awareness isn&amp;rsquo;t a rubber band, but it needs to be stretched&amp;rdquo;, says Deepak Chopra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how do we stretch this band? How do we develop self awareness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patanjali says, only when we are able to stop our thought whirls, we are able to establish in our selves, and when we are able to establish in our selves, we are able to develop self awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;abhava pratyaya alambana vritti nidra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repetitive unawareness is based upon lack of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 09</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra09/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sabda jnana anupati vastu sunyo vikalpah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illusioned or Imagined situations are based on worded knowledge, devoid of substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sutra, Patanjali states, Vikalpa, as the third reason for hurtful or not hurtful thought whirls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vikalpa can be understood as the one based on imagination. Vikalpa is the one, which is Kalpaniic, illusionary. The environment that we live in, becomes the breeding ground to our imagination. What we perceive through our senses is the truth and nothing beyond that, is the truth - this kind of thinking is vikalpa. And this illusion, becomes the cause to an endless stream of thoughts, hurtful or not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to our example of a boy meeting a girl at a wedding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A boy meets a girl at the wedding. The girl looks at the boy and smiles. Nothing beyond that! However, the boy starts imagining about how the girl may be in love with him and how the girl may want to get married to him. In this case, all that the girl did, was to smile. And the rest was imagined by the boy. And when, this did not happen in reality, the boy was hurt. He could not stop thinking of the girl. He felt rejected. He felt depressed. And the reason for his pain, his depression, his rejection, was not the girl, but the imaginary castles that boy build in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vikalpa can be understood as a day dream, fancy, a mirage, a hallucination ‚Äì a kalpana ‚Äì where things do not exist in reality. But then, how can we tell, whether our own mental images are accurate or vivid, when we have no direct comparison? How do we judge the contents of our own minds? Researchers in Sweden have found that our imagination can change our perception of reality. Our mind can play tricks on us by changing illusions of what we think, hear and see, into what seems like reality!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to save the mind from such thought whirls, from such situations, Patanjali says that we need observe our thoughts. Only and only, when we observe our thoughts, we get a clear idea of what is truth and what is imaginary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sabda jnana anupati vastu sunyo vikalpah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illusional or Imagined situations are based on worded knowledge, devoid of substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 08</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra08/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;viparyayo mithya jnanam atadrupa pratistham&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misinterpretations are based upon false perceptions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viparya, comes from the word Paryaya, and the meaning of Paryaya is interpretation. Vi means contrary to. So one that is contrary to interpretation, can be understood as misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patanjali says incorrect knowledge, lack of information, wrong or distorted perception, form the base to misinterpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to our example of the boy meets a girl at the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She smiles and at one of her cousins and the boy misinterprets that the girl is smiling at him and he feels that she is interested in him. It is his distorted sense of perception, that leads him to think in this manner. He goes and asks her, whether she loves him. She denies. He is heart broken. He is disturbed. He picks up a fight with her. He uses foul language and makes a scene. And even after doing all this, he cannot stop thinking about her. He is in pain. And the cause of his pain comes from the fact that he misinterpreted her gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of how we often perceive a person or a situation or to be one way, and only to later discover that there was some missing element in our understanding, and this discovery changes our perception completely. And the problem with these misinterpretations are that they become the root cause of stress, ego, negativity and fear in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if we are in a financially difficult position, and we are invited to a social event, we are hesitant to join. Our inner complexes make us feel, that because we are not financially doing well, our relatives may have us invited to show off their affluence. On the other hand, if we are doing financially well, and we are invited for a social event, our perceptions tell us, that because we are doing socially well, we are invited, or else no one would have bothered too call us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that‚Äôs why, the Talmud says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not see things the way they are, We see things the way we are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our reflection that we seek in the society. And only if we are aware of our misperceptions, we shall be able to correct them, which in turn shall save us from negative, stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;viparyayo mithya jnanam atadrupa pratistham&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misinterpretations are based upon considering false perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 07</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra07/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;pratyaksa anumana agamah pramanani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons for being right are based upon seen experiences, interpretations and ancient scriptures. In the previous sutras, Patanjali lists the 5 reasons for the thought whirls. Pramana or right knowledge, being the foremost in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sutra, Patanjali, states, that Pramana, the knowledge, can be attained from three sources: seen or direct experiences, interpretation and ancient scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, as humans, base our decisions or opinions on our judgements. And our judgements are based on our experiences, on our understanding and on our reading of ancient books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pramana can be well understood with the example of a boy meets a girl. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. The girl looks at the boy and she tells him that she is in love with him and wants to get married. This event creates a series of thoughts whirls in the mind of the boy. This is case of Pramana, where the boy has a direct experience of meeting the girl and hearing her say that she loves him. She wants to get married to him. In this case, the event or the emotion is directly seen and perceived by the boy. And depending on the boy‚Äôs situation, it can be hurtful or not. This thought can be non-hurting, if the boy likes the girl. It would rather make him happy. But, just in case, he does not like her, or is in love with someone else, and he is in a situation that he cannot say no to her, it can be hurtful ‚Äì however the event has created a situation where he is constantly thinking of what has happened. What he has directly saw and experienced, become the starting point to a continuous chain of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when one just understands a subject or a thought, has knowledge about it, but has no experiences, or validation? In such cases these individuals who are authorities on a subject, but have no practical experience of the same. It leads to memorization or mere intellectualization. Their understanding is not complete or mature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember my experience with a famous gynecologist in my home town. When she started practicing, she was unmarried, young and did not have kids of her own. Her approach towards her patients was very indifferent and cold. However, later, when she got married and had kids of her own, her attitude changed dramatically. She became warm and compassionate. Our understanding of a subject, our perspective, undergoes a lot of change, when we ourselves live these experiences. When we walk the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;pratyaksa anumana agamah pramanani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons for being right are based upon seen experiences, interpretations and ancient scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 06</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra06/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;pramana viparyaya vikalpa nidra smritayah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being right, misinterpretation, illusion, unawareness, and past remembrances. After categorizing the thoughts patterns as hurting or not, Patanjali states the 5 sources from where these thought whirls emanate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pramana / right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viparyaya / misinterpreted or incorrect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vikalpa / illusion imagined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nidra / unaware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smriti / based on past memories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patanjali says that although we encounter countless types of thoughts, the reasons for these thoughts whirls can be divided into 5 categories. This simplification itself is very relaxing for us, for only if we are able to observe our thoughts well, if we are able to witness them, by knowing the root cause of their emergence, we are able cease the whirls created by them, and we are able to break the unending pattern. And when we are able to cease these thought whirls, we are able to establish in our true nature. And when we do so, our discretionary powers improve, and when our discretionary powers improve, the choices that we make, are correct, and these correct choices, pave the road to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs understand the 5 types of reasons behind our thought whirls, using a simple example of a boy meeting a girl at a wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First is Pramana&lt;/em&gt;: Based on direct perception and experience. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. The girl looks at the boy and tells him that she loves him and wants to get married to him. A case of Pramana, where the boy has a direct experience of meeting the girl and hearing her say that she loves him and wants to get married. He is continuously thinking about her words. Why, because he has heard, by himself. And he is sure of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second is Viparya&lt;/em&gt;: Comes from the word Paryaya, the meaning of Paryaya is Matlab or interpretation.Vi means the contrary to. The one that is opposite of the true meaning, or interpretation, is misinterpretation. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She smiles and at one of her cousins and he misinterprets that the girl is smiling at him and is interested in him. He goes and asks her whether she loves him. She denies. He is heart broken. And cannot stop thinking about her. In this case, the pain comes from the fact that he misinterpreted her gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third is Vikalpa&lt;/em&gt;: Based on imagination, based on kalpana or bhram and bhram can arise from any of the 5 senses. It is Misperception. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She just looks at the boy and smiles. Nothing more. However, the boy starts imagining about how the girl loves him and how the girl will get married to him and how they will live happily ever after. All that the girl did is smile. The rest was imagined by the boy‚Äôs mind. And when, this does not happen, the boy is hurt. And the reason of this hurt is the imaginary castles that he had build in his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fourth is Nindra&lt;/em&gt;: Based on unawareness. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She looks at him, smiles. She has a small conversation with him and gives subtle suggestions about her interest in him. This boy however, has never interacted with girls before, and hence, he is totally unaware of the feelings the girl is trying to communicate through her gestures. After the event is over, he realises the situation. And now, he is continuously thinking if what had happened. In future, if he gets a chance to meet the girl and convey his thoughts, he shall be happy. But if he does not get this opportunity he is sad, as he feels that he has lost a golden opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifth is Smriti&lt;/em&gt;: Based on memory. A boy meets a girl. She is wearing a pink dress. She looks at him and smiles. In the past, the boy has fond memories of meeting a girl, in the wedding, wearing a pink dress. In the past, the girl had fallen in love with him and there has an affair. So, this time, again, when he sees a girl, at the wedding, smiling at him, he thinks, he has found his beloved. But then, over a period of time, he realises, that this is not the fact, and he is in pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;pramana viparyaya vikalpa nidra smritayah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the truth becomes the foundation to thoughts whirls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 05</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra05/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;vrittayah pancatayah klisht aklishtah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether hurting or non hurting, repetitive thoughts are of five types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talking, what is Yog, and the benefits of establishing in our own nature, Patanjali explains that, what ever, the nature of thought that we witness, hurtful or not, we can divide it into 5 catagories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mind becomes the gate to heaven, the mind become the gate to hell, says Osho. The whole point of Yoga are deeply concerned with the usage of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words, klishta or aklishta, dukhdayak ya na-dukhdayak, represent the two opposites. And The term, is not just limited to be hurtful or not, It is much beyond that. It refers to those thoughts, that lead to progress or those, that do not, Those thoughts that lead to our good, our freedom, our growth, and those thoughts, that do not. Those thoughts that trouble us, or not. And the five type of repetitive thoughts patterns in the mind, lead you to one of the two states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing our thoughts, helps us establish our true nature. And for that, we need to overcome those thoughts that are troublesome, painful and lead to ignorance. For if we are able to witness our thoughts, if we are able to look through them, observe them, categorize them, then we are able to detach ourselves from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;vrittayah pancatayah klisht aklishtah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether hurting or non hurting, repetitive thoughts are of five types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yogsutra: Chapter 1 Sutra 04</title>
      <link>http://swarodaya.com/blog/yogsutra_chapter1_sutra04/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vritti Swaroopam Itratra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At other times, the observer considers himself similar to his thought Whirls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this Sutra, Patanjali indicates how the fluctuations of mind affect you. If you don‚Äôt stop them, you will gradually start identifying yourself as you appear, in these fluctuations. Your swaroop will get lost in the forms of these fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamare Gujratis mein ek kahavat hain, ke ghode ko hum, ghade ke saath bandh dete hain, toh ghoda bhi, thode dino ke baad, ghade jaisa bolne lagta hain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our true self, our consciousness, is like a lump of clay. If clay is moulded as a ball, it starts thinking of itself like a ball. It starts behaving like a ball. People identify it as a ball. What ever shape the clay may take, it does not cease to be the clay. In the same way, we, should not forget, that we are different from our thoughts, that we are different from our influence, we are different from our distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vritti Swaroopam Itratra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are not conscious of this fact, if we are not aware, we shall, eventually start taking form of our fluctuations. The thought whirls shall become our true nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence this sutra is very relevant as parents. Our children mingle in good and bad company, throughout the day. A reminder of this sutra, to ourselves, and to our children, is very important to discourage mob behavior and mindless cult following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Steve Jobs has very aptly stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your time is limited, so don‚Äôt waste it living someone else‚Äôs life. Have the courage to follow your heart and your intuition [‚Ä¶] Everything else is secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vritti Swaroopam Itratra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At other times, the observer considers himself similar to his thought whirls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
