<li>Dhairya Laxmi in the South West</li>
<li>Gaj Laxmi in the West</li>
<li>Vijaya Laxmi in the NorthWest</li>
<li>Dhanlaxmi in the North &amp;</li>
<li>Santan Laxmi in the NorthEast</li>
</ul>

Only when patience is maintained among residents, long term relationships can survive.</p>

<p>Vijaya Laxmi resides in the North west. She ensures that the residents are well supported in every manner and walk of life that leads to their smooth success. Success comes only when one gets complete support from all walks of life. Or else, in absence of lacking support, success cannot be sustained. Rudra and Rajyakshama in the North west ensure that the residents enjoy the regular flow of support as and when needed.</p>

Aishwarya Laxmi of the East teams up with the Gaj Laxmi of the west and together to ensure that the residents enjoy a high status with comforts and luxury. Dhanya Laxmi of the South East teams up with the Vijaya Laxmi of the North West to ensure that the cash generated in the South East is available as support as and when needed. Dhan Laxmi of the North joins hands with Adi Laxmi of the South and ensures that the money that is generated through opportunities is handled well and passed to generations in form of wealth, values and culture. The Santan Laxmi of the North East in combination with Dhairya Laxmi of the South West ensures that once a family is blessed with children, they receive a healthy and a happy environment to flourish and grow.</p>
