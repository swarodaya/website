                                <p>Yog Sutra: 1.30 to 1.33</p>

<p>How to retain the experience of God: the meditative state.</p>

<p>In the previous sutras, Patanjali discussed the various challenges as - guilt, sadness, doubt, carelessness, laziness, indulgences, illusion, loss of clarity and mental disturbances. These states, disturb and disrupt the subconscious. With faith and dedication towards God, these states can be dissolved. These disturbed states cause mental stress, depression, breathlessness and tremors in the body. Actions conducted in these states do not yield to meaningful results and these results become the cause to depression, breathlessness and disturbances in body.</p>

<p>Feelings of extreme guilt give rise to disease in the body and mental guilt gives rise to illnesses. The disturbances in the relationships imparts a sense of worthlessness in life, which leads to drinking, and giving rise to liver problems. Lot of self-doubt leads to skin-allergies and lot regret on the actions of the past, leads to itching. Most diseases are caused due to negative emotions in life, different kind of negative emotions give rise to different kinds of problems in different parts of the body.</p>

<p>Sadness can be understood as the absence of happiness and fun. The reason behind this is the negative emotion and thought that comes to our minds and settles on it’s surface like a layer of dust. Due to this layer of negativity, the mind is unable to feel the happiness. However, through the experiences of meditations, this layer can be removed and the mind can be restored to its natural state of happiness. An intense state of sadness causes problems of depression.</p>

<p>The fear of losses keeps the mind in doubt and the absence of faith and confidence makes the subconscious doubtful. The ability to make correct decisions and achievements in life is hampered. By keeping trust and faith, it may happen, that you may get cheated once-in-a-while, however it does not happen always. Faith and trust guides your subconscious in those situations, where you are prone to get cheated and in this way, you are saved from losing the prosperity which otherwise you would have lost if you would have heeded to your fears and doubts.</p>

<p>Carelessness and absence of awareness leads to overconfidence. This too, arises from a disturbed subconscious. Jap (repetition) and Smaran (recall) can help dissolve these challenges. The main cause of laziness is being attached to unorganised thought processes.</p>

<p>Sexual indulgence is a natural attribute in a certain age. However for some over-sensitive people, it forms a long lasting inner impression. For such people start living their sexual fantasies anywhere and anytime, which leads to distraction of the mind, and the ability to complete the tasks effectively takes a back seat. The mental energy starts to dissipate and work-effectiveness reduces.</p>

<p>Meditation sets in the awareness that the desires of sensual pleasure of touch, based on fantasy, drains away a lot of your mental energies, which could have been utilised to complete a lot of important and pending tasks. With this awareness, an individual can channelize the sexual energy and use it at the right time and at the right place and not at the wrong time and place which leads to mental disturbances.</p>

<p>The cause for illusion is also the absence of the mature grasping ability of the senses, while the other reason being the mental instability. By being aware of the senses and the activation of the subconscious, these situations are be overcome soon. By only two weeks of meditation, these situations can be overcome and your proficiency in the tasks improves in a way that it is noticeable by others too.</p>

<p>Patanjali describes the absence of vision as - darshanalabdh. Darshan means vision and Alabdh means the unavailability. Here, vision does not mean the literally seeing through eyes, nor does the unavailability means the incapacity to purchase. Let us understand these two words through example, which shall help us understand the further sutras with ease.</p>

<p>Me and my family were visiting universal studios with a few family friends. A discussion started about the benefits of designing or living in a vastu compliant home. Among us, was a business friend who used to follow the rules of vastu and had faith in the system. While among us, was another friend had least interest or exposure of vastu and was not bothered. Both of them lead a successful and prosperous life. Both of them presented their viewpoints. A heated discussion took place with fresh hot snacks as I watched in complete silence. When it got over, I was asked my take on vastu. I opinined that let us have a look at the vastu of the universal studios and then shall continue the discussion in the evening.</p>

<p>We reached the studios and were feeling very good. While have a ride on the train to look at the movie sets, conversations with the studio guide followed. Looking at the capacity of the train and the amount of people on board, a friend commented on the amount in dollars that would be collected by evening, while the other commented on the expenses that would have taken place in making of the place. The third friend was commenting on the beauty of the pictures around, as I wondered on the vastu perspective of the place which made it so successful. One of the friends, who was an engineer was observing the technical aspects of the place.</p>

<p>The same place at the same time was being evaluated by different people from different perspectives, as the kids enjoyed in their own ways. With all this, we ended our day by visiting the Beverly hills and then returned to the hotel in the evening.</p>

<p>The vastu discussion continued during dinner time with an intention to know my views. I asked my business friend, that today, at the same place, at the same time, why is it that different people talk about different things? He replied that different people belong to different fields and hence they have different thoughts. They have their own perspectives to which I completely agreed. I told him that you run an industry. You also have a driver, and a personal assistant who are mostly with you all the time. Then there is a supplier who supplies you the raw material with which you make your products. However, there is difference between you and them.</p>

<p>Your awareness - forms your opinions, which forms your perspective. For you, it would be very easy to start another factory business, while for others or rather, even the foreman of your factory, this cannot be thought off - as they lack this perspective. Even if the foreman realizes how to run two machines parallelly, he shall be capable to become a production manager. This can happen with awareness - by having an eye for it. By the practicing vastu, the awareness and perspective, both sharpen, as in it, the five elements of nature are to be synchronized in the space of the building. And hence, such a place has to be decided to reside where the inner wisdom makes decision on your behalf.</p>

<p>In absence of this awareness, the individual shall lack perspective - it is this understanding, which Patanjali tries to hint in these sutras. In the past sutras, he explained us how through the medium of meditation, awareness and perspective, can be attained.</p>

<p>The conscious mind is prone to instability, not the subconscious or the unconscious. The instability gives it the ability to constantly evaluate and analyse. However contrasting thoughts that emanate from the subconscious mind - throw it off balance beyond an extent. This leads to wrong decisions and this lead to direct or indirect losses. Meditations provide depth that imparts stability to the mind. Decisions are not based on logical analysis, but rather on wisdom, and this always leads to beneficial and desired results.</p>

<p>Conflict and disturbances in the sub-conscious mind gives rise to mental agony and depression. This further causes disturbances in the rhythmic flow of breath, causing breathlessness. This weakens our will power, and at the slightest of stress, the body undergoes tremble.</p>

<p>Patanjali provides very deep insights in these sutras about the mind-breath connection. The connection between the rhythm of breath and the mental and physical strength. In very stressful situations, the breath becomes heavy and irregular. If you are able to maintain the rhythm of breath, through practice, then you shall be able to overcome very stressful situations and turn them in your favour. The body shall be able to maintain its natural state and you come across as a very influential personality to the opposite person.</p>

<p>Patanjali says that to stop these challenges, one element, one truth, should be meditated upon and practiced regularly. This can be done by understanding the essence of the tatwa, the truth, through the method of meditation, as explained in the forth coming sutras. That one element, or the truth is that which does not hold any doubt or conflict in it. Just like the sound of God, Om or your own breath ; or the light that emanates from fire. That element which has not place of doubt, and only through proper practice it shall be purified.</p>

<p>Patanjali explains this in depth in the forth coming sutras.</p>
