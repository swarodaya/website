Seedless, higher-state samadhi.
In these last sutras of the first pad, Patanjali takes us to the deeper realms of the subconscious through the practice of intuition. These states are of the higher, seedless-samadhi; the regular practice of which is very important for us to know and realize the purpose of our life. Just like success, samadhi is not a destination. It is journey - the difference is that instead of travelling on rugged and rough, directionless and maze-like roads, the journey is pre-decided, aware and meaningful, in the right direction, on the correct speed, and on the karma-marga (the path of action), taking life to higher levels.

															Does the Vastu of the home play an important role in attainment of this purpose?
Yes, It does. What we understand as Vastu &ndash; the 16 Zones or the 45 Devtas &ndash; is basically the play of the five elements: Space, Air, Fire, Earth, and Water in different permutations and combinations which are present in any given place and time. Let us evaluate each element and observe its role in this context.

Wisdom through Self-Realization.
Along with self realisation comes a new thought &ndash; new insight &ndash; imparting a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; feel. It feels as if some knot in the mind has been untangled and the mind is lighter, clearer, and is filled with new thoughts. Patanjali defines this state of mind with a new term &ldquo;Sampragyata&rdquo; &ndash; insight or inner wisdom. Many a times, people consider this to be a state of Samadhi.

															One of the fundamental challenges faced by people is their inability to grasp the root of problems and address the same meaningfully. This can be in terms of Vastu or any other domain of life.

Self realisation through Yog.
Recurring thoughts that surface on the subconscious mind can be controlled with Abhyasa (Practice) and Vairagya (Dispassion).
1.12 Patanjali Yog Sutra.
When, for the first time, I heard this from Guruji, an inner voice echoed saying that this is “impossible”; this cannot happen as I always believed that the flow of thoughts is natural! And also at the same time, got a feeling that &ndash; hope my Guruji is not getting senile!

															Moments from Mahabharata: Garuda, Matali and Indra Dev (South-West).
Garuda was the king of birds. Matali was the charioteer to Indra Dev. One day, in a moment of arrogance, Garuda insisted on eating Sumukha &ndash; the serpent, who was to be married to Matali&rsquo;s daughter. Matali begs Garuda not to do so. Yet, Garuda refuses to budge. Finally, Matali requests Indra to intervene. To humble Garuda, Indra gently places his hand on his back.

There are five reasons that take one beyond the control of the self.
Recurring thoughts can be painful as well as non-painful. An example of painful thought can be, when the behaviour of a friend does not meet one’s expectation, or when one gets recurring thoughts of another’s painful behaviour. Or, when you do not get due recognition for your efforts.
These recurring thoughts become the cause of pain in the mind.

Yog means &ndash; to stay within yourself.
Some thought patterns recur continuously in one&rsquo;s subconscious. For example, if you had an argument with someone during the day, then just before bedtime the entire sequence of events replays on your mind just like a movie. Even though you do not wish to think about it, these thoughts continuously surface in your mind. For example, thoughts like “he should not have said this”, or “I should have said that”, or “I too tried to explain saying this”, or “why is he saying this?

It&rsquo;s fundamental belief stems from the fact that there is one universal consciousness and we and everything that we see, are a part of it. Everything that we see, is interlinked and interconnected.

Past remembrances are based on our inability to let go experiences.

Memories, whether good or bad, become the foundation to our feelings and this foundation, forms our mind-set. Whatever we experiance gets permanently recorded in our minds, and as per the context, this recording starts playing.

Illusioned or Imagined situations are based on worded knowledge, devoid of substance.

What we perceive through our senses is the truth and nothing beyond that, is the truth - this kind of thinking is vikalpa.

															<h2><a href='http://swarodaya.com/blog/20141212-aditi-and-diti/'> Aditi and Diti: The Intriguing and Opposing Energy Fields</a> </h2>
															<h4>Fri, Dec 12, 2014</h4>
															In Hindu mythology, Aditi and Diti are referred to as the wives of Sage Kshayap and the daughters of legendary King Prajapati Dakhsa, son of Brahma. In vastu shastra, NorthEast encompasses the energy Diti and NNE encompasses the energy field of Aditi. Below, I have tried to summarize my understanding of these two mythical, powerful energy fields that exist right next to each other on the Mahavastu shakti-chakra.
Aditi In Sanskrit, Aditi means limitless, unbound, free, and unfettered.

															<h2><a href='http://swarodaya.com/blog/20140916-clutter/'> Clutter: The Influence of SSW in Rest of the Zones</a> </h2>
															<h4>Tue, Sep 16, 2014</h4>
															Rarely does anyone talk about this or hardly does one consider this to be a cause for concern. But a space full of clutter is just incapable of inviting peace and prosperity.
Clutter comes in many forms. It can be emotional (I am unable to dispose, my kids&rsquo; first t-shirts, their baby books, their first toys) or it can be in the form of clothes that I once bought, but no longer fit in!
