_Vritti Swaroopam Itratra_

At other times, the observer considers himself similar to his thought Whirls.

In this Sutra, Patanjali indicates how the fluctuations of mind affect you. If you don’t stop them, you will gradually start identifying yourself as you appear, in these fluctuations. Your swaroop will get lost in the forms of these fluctuations.

Hamare Gujratis mein ek kahavat hain, ke ghode ko hum, ghade ke saath bandh dete hain, toh ghoda bhi, thode dino ke baad, ghade jaisa bolne lagta hain.

Our true self, our consciousness, is like a lump of clay. If clay is moulded as a ball, it starts thinking of itself like a ball. It starts behaving like a ball. People identify it as a ball. What ever shape the clay may take, it does not cease to be the clay. In the same way, we, should not forget, that we are different from our thoughts, that we are different from our influence, we are different from our distractions.

_Vritti Swaroopam Itratra_

If we are not conscious of this fact, if we are not aware, we shall, eventually start taking form of our fluctuations. The thought whirls shall become our true nature.

Hence this sutra is very relevant as parents. Our children mingle in good and bad company, throughout the day. A reminder of this sutra, to ourselves, and to our children, is very important to discourage mob behavior and mindless cult following.

As Steve Jobs has very aptly stated:

> Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Have the courage to follow your heart and your intuition […] Everything else is secondary.

Hence,

_Vritti Swaroopam Itratra_

At other times, the observer considers himself similar to his thought whirls.

Thank you.
