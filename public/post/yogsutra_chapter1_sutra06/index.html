                        <p></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="container">
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                                <p><em>pramana viparyaya vikalpa nidra smritayah</em></p>

<p>Being right, misinterpretation, illusion, unawareness, and past remembrances. After categorizing the thoughts patterns as hurting or not, Patanjali states the 5 sources from where these thought whirls emanate.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pramana / right</li>
<li>Viparyaya / misinterpreted or incorrect</li>
<li>Vikalpa / illusion imagined</li>
<li>Nidra / unaware</li>
<li>Smriti / based on past memories</li>
</ul>

<p>Patanjali says that although we encounter countless types of thoughts, the reasons for these thoughts whirls can be divided into 5 categories. This simplification itself is very relaxing for us, for only if we are able to observe our thoughts well, if we are able to witness them, by knowing the root cause of their emergence, we are able cease the whirls created by them, and we are able to break the unending pattern. And when we are able to cease these thought whirls, we are able to establish in our true nature. And when we do so, our discretionary powers improve, and when our discretionary powers improve, the choices that we make, are correct, and these correct choices, pave the road to success.</p>

<p>Let’s understand the 5 types of reasons behind our thought whirls, using a simple example of a boy meeting a girl at a wedding.</p>

<p><em>First is Pramana</em>: Based on direct perception and experience. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. The girl looks at the boy and tells him that she loves him and wants to get married to him. A case of Pramana, where the boy has a direct experience of meeting the girl and hearing her say that she loves him and wants to get married. He is continuously thinking about her words. Why, because he has heard, by himself. And he is sure of it.</p>

<p><em>Second is Viparya</em>: Comes from the word Paryaya, the meaning of Paryaya is Matlab or interpretation.Vi means the contrary to. The one that is opposite of the true meaning, or interpretation, is misinterpretation. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She smiles and at one of her cousins and he misinterprets that the girl is smiling at him and is interested in him. He goes and asks her whether she loves him. She denies. He is heart broken. And cannot stop thinking about her. In this case, the pain comes from the fact that he misinterpreted her gestures.</p>

<p><em>Third is Vikalpa</em>: Based on imagination, based on kalpana or bhram and bhram can arise from any of the 5 senses. It is Misperception. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She just looks at the boy and smiles. Nothing more. However, the boy starts imagining about how the girl loves him and how the girl will get married to him and how they will live happily ever after. All that the girl did is smile. The rest was imagined by the boy’s mind. And when, this does not happen, the boy is hurt. And the reason of this hurt is the imaginary castles that he had build in his head.</p>

<p><em>Fourth is Nindra</em>: Based on unawareness. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She looks at him, smiles. She has a small conversation with him and gives subtle suggestions about her interest in him. This boy however, has never interacted with girls before, and hence, he is totally unaware of the feelings the girl is trying to communicate through her gestures. After the event is over, he realises the situation. And now, he is continuously thinking if what had happened. In future, if he gets a chance to meet the girl and convey his thoughts, he shall be happy. But if he does not get this opportunity he is sad, as he feels that he has lost a golden opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Fifth is Smriti</em>: Based on memory. A boy meets a girl. She is wearing a pink dress. She looks at him and smiles. In the past, the boy has fond memories of meeting a girl, in the wedding, wearing a pink dress. In the past, the girl had fallen in love with him and there has an affair. So, this time, again, when he sees a girl, at the wedding, smiling at him, he thinks, he has found his beloved. But then, over a period of time, he realises, that this is not the fact, and he is in pain.</p>

<p>Hence,</p>

<p><em>pramana viparyaya vikalpa nidra smritayah</em></p>

<p>Knowledge of the truth becomes the foundation to thoughts whirls.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
