      <description>Yog Chitta Vritti Nirodah
Yog is stopping the Whirls of repetitive thoughts in subconscious
After asking us to be prepared, Patanjali directly comes to the point. Though this sutra is just the second sutra, it holds the key, to the entire samadhi pad.
It says that Yog, union, is only possible, when one removes all kind of obstacles. all kind of disturbances, all kind of fluctuations from one’s mind.
Mind – what are the different states of mind?</description>

      <description>Before we start, I would want to thank -
The wind beneath my wings,
For holding me strong as I weathered the storm,
For helping me soar and ensuring I rise,
To the wind beneath my winds.
Gratitude to you, the reader of this blog.
Chapter one: Sutra one.
Atha Yog Anushasanam
Now, the journey of Yog.
The word “now” is very important here. it shows that you are starting now, with a kind of preparation.</description>
