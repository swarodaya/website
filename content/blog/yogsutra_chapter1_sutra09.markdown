_sabda jnana anupati vastu sunyo vikalpah_

Illusioned or Imagined situations are based on worded knowledge, devoid of substance.

In this sutra, Patanjali states, Vikalpa, as the third reason for hurtful or not hurtful thought whirls.

Vikalpa can be understood as the one based on imagination. Vikalpa is the one, which is Kalpaniic, illusionary. The environment that we live in, becomes the breeding ground to our imagination. What we perceive through our senses is the truth and nothing beyond that, is the truth - this kind of thinking is vikalpa. And this illusion, becomes the cause to an endless stream of thoughts, hurtful or not!

Coming to our example of a boy meeting a girl at a wedding:

> A boy meets a girl at the wedding. The girl looks at the boy and smiles. Nothing beyond that! However, the boy starts imagining about how the girl may be in love with him and how the girl may want to get married to him. In this case, all that the girl did, was to smile. And the rest was imagined by the boy. And when, this did not happen in reality, the boy was hurt. He could not stop thinking of the girl. He felt rejected. He felt depressed. And the reason for his pain, his depression, his rejection, was not the girl, but the imaginary castles that boy build in the air.

Vikalpa can be understood as a day dream, fancy, a mirage, a hallucination – a kalpana – where things do not exist in reality. But then, how can we tell, whether our own mental images are accurate or vivid, when we have no direct comparison? How do we judge the contents of our own minds? Researchers in Sweden have found that our imagination can change our perception of reality. Our mind can play tricks on us by changing illusions of what we think, hear and see, into what seems like reality!

And to save the mind from such thought whirls, from such situations, Patanjali says that we need observe our thoughts. Only and only, when we observe our thoughts, we get a clear idea of what is truth and what is imaginary!

Hence,

_sabda jnana anupati vastu sunyo vikalpah_

Illusional or Imagined situations are based on worded knowledge, devoid of substance.

Thank you.
