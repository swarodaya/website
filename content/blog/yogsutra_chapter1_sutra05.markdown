_vrittayah pancatayah klisht aklishtah_

Whether hurting or non hurting, repetitive thoughts are of five types.

After talking, what is Yog, and the benefits of establishing in our own nature, Patanjali explains that, what ever, the nature of thought that we witness, hurtful or not, we can divide it into 5 catagories.

The Mind becomes the gate to heaven, the mind become the gate to hell, says Osho. The whole point of Yoga are deeply concerned with the usage of the mind.

The words, klishta or aklishta, dukhdayak ya na-dukhdayak, represent the two opposites. And The term, is not just limited to be hurtful or not, It is much beyond that. It refers to those thoughts, that lead to progress or those, that do not, Those thoughts that lead to our good, our freedom, our growth, and those thoughts, that do not. Those thoughts that trouble us, or not. And the five type of repetitive thoughts patterns in the mind, lead you to one of the two states.

Observing our thoughts, helps us establish our true nature. And for that, we need to overcome those thoughts that are troublesome, painful and lead to ignorance. For if we are able to witness our thoughts, if we are able to look through them, observe them, categorize them, then we are able to detach ourselves from them.

Hence,
