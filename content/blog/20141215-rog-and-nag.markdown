### Rog: The Weakener

The first energy field from the northern direction is called Rog. 

**Sanskrit Meaning**: Sickness or disease or breaking of the strength.

**Zone**: NW

**Attribute**: 

Roga means Jvara or fever. And the lunar divinity ruling it is Svati ( Nakshatra). The ruling deity of Svati is mentioned to be Vayu. Vayu, here is referred as, the not just as the God of Wind, but also the 'Prana', the breath of life. 

In Shrimad Bhagvatam ( 4.29.17), it is mentioned that 

> "Without life-air, we lose the sense of 'I'. This usually happens in deep sleep, in unconscious, in high fever, in a state of terrible shock or in death". 

This reddish energy field is considered the one that destroys the diseases provides you with the energy during tough times. It is likened to an invertor, which provides you the power back up. When this energy field is imbalanced, the individual fails to get support during difficult times. 

**Entrance Effect**: N1

When there is an entrance placed here, this energy field is disturbed and weakened. Hence, there are chances that individuals suffer from diseases which causes a loss of vitality and strength. It weakens an individual to a great extent, and is prone to diseases that may be life-threatening, and may be a of cause death. 

At a few Vastu related books, the effects of this door have been mentioned as death, and not death through murder (as mentioned in 45 powers of Alchemy). 

### Nag: The Craving 

The second energy field in the northern direction is know as Nag. 

**Zone**: NNW.

**Sanskrit Meaning**: The king or the great snake.

**Attribute**: 

The attribute of this red energy field is to provide enjoyments. It is the power that controls the tendencies pertaining to Muladhara Chakra. It generates lust and desires. In mythology, it is mentioned as the weapon to Kamdev. 

**Entrance Effect**: N2 

In Hindu mythology, Vasuki, is considered as the king of snakes. Vasuki snake holds a precious mani 'gem-stone', on its head. Although, this precious mani (gem-stone), has enticed many individuals to steal and posses, the poison of the Vasuki snake makes this act impossible, hence, resulting into a feeling of enmity and jealously.

Hence, whenever an entrance is placed in this energy field, this aspect of the energy field gets activated, and the inmates face enmity and jealously of others. 

While studying for the advance course, I have gathered this information from several books and mainly Internet. I am just sharing my interpretation of the information that I have read.
