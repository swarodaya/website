Yog Sutra: Chapter 1.12 to 1.16

Self realisation through Yog. 

Recurring thoughts that surface on the subconscious mind can be controlled with Abhyasa (Practice) and Vairagya (Dispassion). 

1.12 Patanjali Yog Sutra. 

When, for the first time, I heard this from Guruji, an inner voice echoed saying that this is ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù; this cannot happen as I always believed that the flow of thoughts is natural! And also at the same time, got a feeling that -- hope my Guruji is not getting senile! This conversation took place in the year 1993, where along with the study Samkhya Karika, Guruji discussed Patanjali Yog Sutras too. With a smile, he replied, ‚ÄúThis is important as well as necessary for you, for this is the first step towards the experience of ‚ÄúSiddhis‚Äù. This is also important for you to understand Vastu in depth‚Äù. I felt as if he had read my thoughts. 

In the forthcoming sutras he commented, ‚ÄúFor an understanding of Patanjali Yog sutras, experience of life is needed, which shall come with time. But as of now, you just memorise them and understand. As your subconscious shall pass through various diversities of life, these sutras shall guide you. You are eager, enthusiastic, and have a tendency of taking risks. (I thought that he hinted towards my decision of leaving the profession of software and deciding to learn Vastu in a small village.) But with experience, you shall be able to internalise them. 

The word of the Guru is above all. He answered all my silly questions with patience and ease. The essence of these sutras started to surface. Clarity towards life started to increase with every passing day. Today I realize that his every word was eternal. 

It is 100 percent, a true fact, that by Abhyasa (constant practice) and Vairagya (dispassion), the recurring thoughts can be completely stilled. You shall realize this through the practice of a few days. Patanjali step-by-step helps you establish in beautiful states of the subconscious. Defining every word, internalizing it with clarity, practicing the mind, in the most beautiful and most simple manner explaining Abhyasa and Vairagya and leading it towards self realisation. In this journey of yog sutras, Patanjali does not refer to any external or physical practices. He only refers to subject of the subconscious and the conscious mind. He refers to the body as not a physical form, but a form of the soul. Mere attention of these have to be kept in mind in the complete journey of subconscious.

A deliberate effort to establish stability is Abhyasa (practice). Abhyasa does not mean to operate mechanically. But it rather means to insert deliberate effort in it so much so that it comes naturally. Just as with practice in music, the tune and rhythm in music naturally sets in. Or with practice, any act can be performed effortlessly. Then to do it effortlessly becomes the regular practice. And then, practicing this state (of regular practice) with devotion, establishes the process firmly. The method mentioned in the forthcoming sutras help in establishing the practice firmly.

Patanjali holds a non-dualist opinion about dispassion. He states that by not succumbing to the cravings of matters that are heard or seen, develops a regulated wisdom or understanding. This is dispassion. Dispassion does not mean to give up desires, to stay away from worldly matters, or to give up everything. Usually ‚Äúdispassion‚Äù is wrongly associated with these emotions. Patanjali was the creator of Yog. He states that by maintaining a desire-free approach towards the cravings that arise from matters seen or heard and developing a state of non-indulgence is dispassion. Passion is indulgence. Yog sutras refer to dispassion in this reference.

In day-to-day life, you do practice this. By paying attention, you shall be able to get the jist of it. By understanding the true meaning, you shall be able to internalize this as well as practice it too.

For example, you see a new car (or any other object) or hear about it and there-on stems a craving to own it. Until you don't get it, you tend to remain restless. And once you get it, you treat it with utmost care. If it gets damaged even a bit, you are agitated and disturbed. Till the car remains In perfect condition, the mind is happy. If not, the mind is agitated. This state is the state of indulgence.

Your emotion should be, ‚ÄúYes, done. We shall get it‚Äù.  Even if you are planning to get it the very next day, you should be continuing with your daily chores without getting diverted, or indulging into emotions related to it. And when you procure the car, even while you are accepting good wishes about the car, your attitude should be composed without flowing into emotions of indulgence or excitement. If there is a scratch on the car, your blood should not boil nor should you be disheartened. You must remain calm. And if someone starts to react, your response should be -- it's ok, does not matter. It is not about external responses, but the thought process within.

This is dispassion; non indulgence. This does not mean giving up of worldly life, desires, or the ambition to move ahead or giving up success and prosperity. As per Patanjali, these are the states of a disturbed mind; not of a focussed one. And in the next sutras, Patanjali talks about attaining beautiful life where all desires are met and wishes are fulfilled. But without submitting to your cravings or remaining away from your indulgences -- as this is required for achieving bigger targets of life.

In a higher state of being, free of indulgence towards all the three gunas (Rajas, Tamas, and Satva) leads to a state of self-realisation. Patanjali uses the word ‚ÄúPurushkhyate‚Äù, for self realisation. The meaning of Purush is all-pervasive, eternal, the one that never changes just as the sky or soul. Khyate means to know, to realize. This is the true form of the self -- pure Chaitanya, the Purush Tatwa (element). Prakriti is the Feminine Tatwa (Element). Together, they combine to form the universe.

Then Patanjali talks about attaining depth in self realisation through various methods. Here onwards, in the journey of Yog, we shall understand the outlook of Patanjali by this definition.. Patanjali states about being free of desires over the three gunas. Let us experience these before we move ahead.

Prakriti is tri-gunatmak, and the mind too, is attached to one of these states in permutation or combination. These three Gunas are: Satwa, Rajas, and Tamas. Fundamentally, these are the three states of the subconscious. When established in Satwa, the subconscious is pure, aware and filled with clarity. A mind established in Rajas is in constant flux, looking or asking for some action. A mind established in Tamas is inactive -- unaware and disturbed.

The subconscious is never steady in either of the three states. When in a state filled with awareness and clarity, it is eager to create. And then it goes to an unaware, disturbed, and an inactive state. And as life proceeds, it gets used to being in one of these three states. And continues to remain so.

By being an observer, you can experience these states of the subconscious. Or by recalling the experiences of the past, you can understand the three Gunas. Patanjali says, ‚ÄùIn higher state of Vairagya (dispassion), by maintaining a state of non-indulgence towards these situations, you shall be able to know the eternal that stands behind these. And that is your true form.
