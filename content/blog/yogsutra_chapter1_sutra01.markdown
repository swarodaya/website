Before we start, I would want to thank -

_The wind beneath my wings,_  
_For holding me strong as I weathered the storm,_  
_For helping me soar and ensuring I rise,_  
_To the wind beneath my winds._

Gratitude to you, the reader of this blog.

Chapter one: Sutra one.

_Atha Yog Anushasanam_

Now, the journey of Yog.

The word “now” is very important here. it shows that you are starting now, with a kind of preparation.

Hindu philosophy is be broadly divided into three parts: Sankhya, which tells us why do we need a better world, Yog, which tells us that how can we make it happen, and Vendanta, which tells us, that once we reach a better world, what shall we attain?

So with the word ‘now’ here, Patanjali, believes that you are here, after doing a lot of homework. You are here with a lot of preparation. You have studied the philosophy of Sankhaya well.

What is the philosophy of Sankhaya? It is the philosophy of duality. Sankhya darshan regards the universe, of consisting of only two realities. Purush and Prakriti. Purush is the one that is stable, constant, while Prakriti is the variable factor.

It’s like the nose, which is the stable, while the fragrance, it smells, is the variable factor. The microchips, the processor, the cell phone, the tv – they are the constant, the Purush. While the channels that we see, the programmes that we come across, the data that is stored in them, is the variable element.

So Patanjali, says, that after knowing about Purush and Prakriti, after knowing about the constant and the variable, let us work on the variable factor of the equation, which would help us become better happier human and successful human beings.

Hence,

_Atha, Yog Anushanshanam_

Lets begin the journey of Yog …

Thank you.
