Yog Sutra: 1.34 to 1.41

The Effective Methods for Dhyan.

In these sutras, Patanjali imparts the best and the most effective methods to meditate. These methods are extremely simple, and yet, highly effective when practiced. You will find a huge difference with a few days of practice. Along with meditations, we shall also discuss these methods in detail.

The first method involves the practice of observing the pause after the exhalation of breath. This method can be comfortably practiced sitting on the chair, sofa, bed or floor. A few things to be kept in mind while observing your breath -

1. Keep your phones switched off for a time of 20 minutes. Request the people around you to not disturb you for 20 minutes. Set an alarm for 20 minutes.

2. Sit crossed legged on the floor or on the bed. Ensure that your spine is well-rested on the backrest of the bed or the wall. The lower back and buttocks should be in contact with the backrest or the wall. This shall ensure that your spine is straight or erect. For comfort, you may use a stiff pillow to sit on.

Sitting on the sofa, you have to ensure that it‚Äôs back should be such that your back and buttocks are chocked on it. Your legs should not dangle and should be rested on the floor. If needed, you may keep a rest under your feet. Close your eyes and relax your body. Rest your hands on your knees. Focus on your breath as it enters and leaves your nostrils. Feel it as it enters and leaves... It enters, it leaves.... Keep observing it for a while. Your mouth should be closed and the breathing should be from the nose. If needed, clean your nose to ensure the uninterrupted flow of breath.

Now the method of meditation. Gently exhale and observe the pause after exhalation. Let the breath flow in with ease. Then gently exhale. Observe the pause. Let the breath flow in naturally. After doing this for a few times, focus your entire attention on exhalation and the pause after the exhalation. After 10-12 times, stop making the conscious gentle effort. All your attention should be on the pause that occurs after the exhalation of breath. Observe the pause. As your breath shall become subtle and long, the pause shall gradually extend. Now observe this pause one inch below your navel. Keep observing it. Experience the gradual increase of the pause. Whatever thoughts cross your mind, let them come, however, as soon as you realize, bring your attention back to your navel.

As soon as the alarm rings, rub your hands. Feeling the warmth, keep them on your eyes, and gently open your eyes. Observe your mental state for a while. Recall this feeling several times of the day so that you can remember it.

As soon as you wake up, if you don‚Äôt have to run to the washroom, do this exercise sitting on the bed. Or else, complete the needed activities, and then sit for meditation. The relaxed state of the body should be made use of, at such times, hence brush and bath too, can be delayed. This can be also done at night if the consumption of alcohol is not done. Within a period of less than a week, you shall observe the stability within you. Meditate naturally, with ease and relaxation. The body has to be let loose. Should not be thinking about anything else. This is the way this method has to be followed.

The second method is of contemplation meditation. You can do it anytime and anywhere. Even as you read this. Only thing is to be conscious about your thoughts. Do it now and evaluate your thoughts. This contemplative meditation too binds and stabilizes the mind. In this method, Patanjali says that - Vishay Vatti Pravruttirupana - meaning that by observing the tendencies arising by seeing and hearing, the mind gets stable. The tendencies arising by hearing can also be termed as habit. When these habits, start creating a disconnect within you, it terms of yog, it need addressal.

Which thought whirls got activated through hearing? Just think about it. What do like listening the most? Let's not think about song and music for a while. Kindly close and and address this question for a while. The book and the eyes closed.

What did you see? A very few people will be able to experience that what they and their ears want to hear, is appreciation. Let us understand the essence of this sutra as Patanjali wants us to. It will help us to contemplate on how to settle the mind in this very moment.

In the past, when someone, appreciated you whether about your memory or beautiful writing, or your beauty, or your facial features or voice, or your ability to comprehend things, or say anything, you would have remembered it until this day. Some people are such that their actions are based solely on the appreciation that they will receive for themselves. What all you do for the pleasure of the hearing faculty! Sometimes, you will give donations, or at times, you will give special emotion to individuals. And at times, you tend to appear and behave special in front of others. Why?

Let's us think about this for a while. Try to recall and understand. When you do not receive appreciation for all your dramas, you are in pain. Repeatedly, for the longing of appreciation, the dramas that you do, the thought, an activity - and you're addressing of it, and you're doing of it - itself is a thought whirl. Observation of these shall provide you with a lot of solutions for your problems and the mind shall begin to stabilise.

When you are enacting such, you hardly realise that you are doing so. It just happens. However the anticipation of hearing appreciation makes your restless. And when you do not receive the same, you are upset. Then your words gain the tone, ‚Äúthere is no appreciation ; there is no point doing anything for others ; there is no respect etc‚Äù. Be slightly thoughtful and try to get away from this mental suffocation. If possible, for forever. Keep your dramatics for the movies, and if you get better at it, you may try your hand in the movies too.

The natural and calm state of your mind, is your eternal beauty. You shall always be able to feel the emotions that arise in the mind of another for it. Words are not needed.

In the same way, the visual pleasures give rise to thought whirls - to see and to show. Do you realise this? Try to observe these thought whirls. To look good, you go to a large extent ; you give a lot of pain to your body ; what not do you care in your diet. And then, seeing your photograph, you comment that this photograph is not a good one.

The reason for this it because the beauty that you are trying to seek in the photograph, is not present in the photograph, as you are always trying to pose as someone else - as some actor, actress or a politician. The beauty of the photograph lies hidden behind these masks. When you start accepting the self, the way you actually are - fat, thin, whatever your facial features are, the way they are - they are naturally beautiful. And do not be hell bent on changing them. Do not be artificial. Accepting the beauty of the self with your inner mind, and you will have the entire world be gazing at you. When you try and be like someone else, the peace of mind, gets disturbed. The effort to look like someone else, takes you away from your own self. Even if you are able to observe this aspect of yourself, you shall be able to establish in your self. Your stability is your beauty - eternal, loving and mesmerising.

The activity of all the five senses combine to give rise to thought whirls. Most of these are such that they cause disturbances within you. Due to this, you shall face conflict and challenges as explained in the previous sutras.

Other senses like touch, feel and smell, too give rise to similar thought whirls. The addiction of taste to a particular brand also generates thought whirls as when you do not get it, you are in pain. Just think about all those industries that are dependent on the sense of smell. Observe it.

One can free himself from the pain that enates from the activities of the senses, by just being observant about them and you can save your mental energies and can channelize your senses towards making the life better and can enjoy the experiences of senses to the fullest.

The sense of touch, is connected with the skin, and is the cause of sensuality. The feel of another to gratify the sense of the self, gives rise to the feelings of sensuality. This can become the cause of pain and melancholy for others. By being aware of your emotions and attitude about the sensations of touch, you shall calm down. The awareness set-in, about it‚Äôs enjoyment at the right place, in the right context, and at the right time, which shall prevent you from being disturbed within .

The contemplative meditation too brings stability in you, and establishes you and frees you from pain and misery.
