Mahabharat is often referred to as the Dharmayudha; and  
Kurukshetra as the Dharmakshetra.

The conflict symbolized here is not the one between the good and the evil, it is the conflict of the ideas of what we consider good and what we consider evil. And, this eternal conflict is internal. It lasts for ever, and is in our mind.

Nature presents us with three choices in our Breath in the form of three Nadis:

- **Ida**: the Heart
- **Pingla**: the Head 
- **Sushumna**: the state of being Neutral

The story of Mahabharat is the story of three choices that every character makes.

This story begins with Shantanu -

Shantanu falls in love with Satyawati - the fisherwomen - who agreed to marriage only if her children had the right to the throne. Although Shantanuâ€™s head did not agree with Satyawati, but at the same time, he could not take Satyawati out of his heart. And in this conflict of the head and the heart, his decision making power stood neutralized. As a result, he did not make a decision, and instead, sunk into depression.

When we stand neutral in life, someone else decides the course of events for us. (When a few decide not to vote, the course of elections is decided by those few who vote.)

Seeing the plight of his father Shantanu, Bhishma decides to act. Bhishma let his heart rule his head. He decides to give up the right to throne, takes a vow of celibacy so that Shantanu can marry Satyavati. His notion of Dharma is the happiness of his father above everything else. And he bases his actions accordingly.

Every character makes one of these three choices based on his or her notion of Dharma in their heads and the sum total of these choices is the War of Mahabharat.

Every moment in our life, we make choices under the influence of these three Nadis. IDA - where our heart rules, PINGLA - where the head takes the lead, or Sushumna - the neutral stand. And the final outcome of life is the sum of the decisions that we make under the influence of these three Nadis.

Take control of these Nadis, and you take control of your life.
