Yog Sutra: 1.34 to 1.41

The Effective Methods for Dhyan.

In the next method, Patanjali says, to illuminate your thinking you need to focus on the non-depressive thoughts. Such thoughts that are uplifting, blissful, and are illuminating; which do not give you pain, remorse or guilt; are non-negative, and are positive. In these sutras, Patanjali states in Sanskrit - Vishoka va Jyotishmati. As I had received the knowledge of the yog sutras through my Guru orally, I never had any doubt in my mind about them. But many a times in discussions, that these word have been misinterpreted as non-depressive light - meaning "tratak" to be done on the light of the ghee lamp. This interpretation is wrong.

Guruji always insisted that Patanjali yog sutras have to be experienced with closed eyes - not with open eyes. And Patanjali Yog Sutra complete the dimension of the inner mind and the states beyond it - it is not about the physical body. Patanjali wants us to transcend beyond the body and to the further states, and not to be limited to the physical body.

When the word is studied, it is actually - 'jyotishmati' - jyotish va mati. Mati is opinion and Jyotish meaning illuminating -- the one that illuminates. One that illuminates thoughts, gives light, imparts non-depressive thinking and positive thoughts.

At times, we read some statements that seem to sort out things within; as if some worries are sorted, or as if the mind is lost and suddenly, it starts seeing solutions in a new light. Even by contemplating on such thoughts, one receives the offerings of the chitt - like peace, stability, and clarity. Many such sayings and proverbs can give you such an experience.

One such statement that inspired me for many years is - God grant me the serenity to accept the things, I cannot change; courage to change the things that I can; and wisdom to know the difference.

Another such sentence is - Life is as Such. Recall and select such fundamental statements, that are uplifting and help you illuminate your thinking.

In the forthcoming sutras, Patanjali shares all the more easy methods with you. By focussing your energy on those who are above attachment of the senses. For the best result of this method, you can choose to focus your attention on those individuals in your circle who are above the attachments of visual and auditory faculties.

Focus your attention on successful and stable personalities. Such as those of whom you can interact and connect on personal basis. If you do not find such people around you, you may choose to focus your attention on concept of Ishwar. However in this sutra, Patanjali, talks about internalizing those personalities who are above ardor and cravings.

Many a times, we do so unknowingly. For example, in some situations, we tend to remember an elder while doing some work. This is exactly what Patanjali is asking us to do and internalize.

In political circles, I tested this method on joint-secretaries and secretaries (who were associated directly with the cabinet ministers), by asking them to internalize the positive emotions of the Minister while making decisions. The secretaries have to make decisions based on the thought that, if the Minister would be the decision maker, what would be the decision of the Minister.

The result was astonishing. Not only that these secretaries gave beautiful performances, but they also played the best of roles in making meaningful decisions for the country. They received such wonderful appreciative response from their seniors and they got promoted to influential posts. In other fields too, this method gave very astonishing results. Select a few individuals in your vicinity and experience its practical working and internalize it.

The next method is for advance level sadhaks. However Patanjali shares it at this point. The test of which should be done after three months of experience of the above mentioned methods. If you do it earlier than that, it will take a long time to succeed in it. However you can be clear in your mind that you can jump directly to this technique. Rest all the methods start showing the result in a few days or in a couple of weeks. In this method, you gain clarity within a month and half. For me, with about three years of meditation experience, I gained clarity of this method in a month.

The method is based on paying attention on knowledge in sleep and dreaming control. It means that the body is asleep and you are aware that you are dreaming. And you would receive the offerings of the consciousness - solutions, peace, clarity and stability - by consciously paying attention on the knowledge accumulated in the dreams.

For me, it is quite surprising that Patanjali mentions this method at this point. For this, Dhyan, Dharana, Samadhi through Sanyam is required, which Patanjali addresses in the third pad. When I shared my thoughts with Guruji, he smilingly admonished me saying the method of extracting knowledge through dreams, has helped many scientists discover many things in dreams. When you do not find solutions through any other method, you shall find them through this method. However, I stuck to my question, and after three years of working on Patanjali, I had put up my view. When I repeated my question again, I was smilingly told - Ask Patanjali!

This question, even after 15 years, suprises me. For me, usage of this method should be included in the third pad. That shall make it easy to act upon. By doing it at this stage, is not a challenge, just that it may take longer.

By stabilizing the mind on any one of the above mentioned methods, practice stopping the thought whirls for at least 15 days. After that, during the 15 minutes of meditation before bedtime, mentally make a ‘dharana’ that you shall make a note of your dreams in your diary when you wake up. Keep a pen and diary handy. You can experience the benefits of making dharana. For example before sleeping, you can decide to wake up at 6 am and be ready by 7 am to leave. In your routine days, even though you may be waking up at 7:30am, but when when you would have made a dharana - you would naturally wake up at 6:00 without any effort. When you are able to practice this method with ease, you shall be able to wake up at the time of your choice without effort.

In three to four days, by making a ‘dharana’ that you shall realize that you are vaguely able to remember all four of your dreams (yes, we generally have four dreams in a night). Then by putting a date to it, you shall note down your dreams in detail. Stress your mind to try and recall the details. Within 15 days, you will realise that your are able to recall them with ease. When you shall be able to recall your dreams completely with clarity, then, you will make the dharana such that -- in my dreams, I shall remember that I am dreaming! Keep noting your dreams in your diary. And eventually, add a sentence that - In my dreams, I shall be taking a hanky out of my pocket (or any such object for that matter which is not present in the pocket). Taking the red hanky out is the indicator of the fact that this is a dream.

Recall the statement several times before sleep. In a week’s time, you shall be able to have the awareness that this is indeed a dream. Put you hand in your pocket, to remove the red hanky and then smilingly put it back.

Now you will be contemplating in your dreams. Recall place, events and subjects. Remember them. If you are not happy with your dream, then in your dreams, closing your eyes, make a dharana saying that I do not wish to see this dream. I wish to see this (the subject of your choice) in the dream. When you shall be able to dream the subject of your choice. Those that address your problems, or those fulfilling your desires; and it can be any! All dreams are in the domain of your subconscious, And then you go back to sleep in your dreams and wake up as per the set alarm and then describe your dream in your diary. Then you may get busy in your daily life. Keep your diary along with you. And whenever you get a chance, read the description in detail.

The knowledge that you receive as an offering imparts peace for the inner mind, clarity and stability. And you receive solutions for those issues, which you fail to receive in daily life. You gain new perspectives in terms of money, success, investment, prosperity, and growth. The limits of knowledge procured from your sleep is limitless.

In the next sutra, Patanjali says, that wherever you focus, wherever your attention is attracted, if you sustain it with awareness, you receive the above mentioned peace, clarity and stability. For practicing of this method, whatever suits you, you may choose to make it the center of your attention. How? For this, you need to understand two things, Patanjali says that it is important, that you choose only one subject as the focus your attention and not, change it. Second is about time. It is not appropriate that as the subject is of your choice, you get in the flow, and not be aware about the time. For then, it is not meditation, it is a habit. It may not hurt you now, but later you may feel guilty about spending much more time than you should have.

Hence, choose a subject of your choice, and delve in it. And when the alarm rings after half an hour or an hour, stop it. Music, sports, beautiful faces, golf, reading-writing, chat, it can be anything. But it has to be done for a specific time period only. After a few days of practice, you shall find yourself more focussed, with better concentration and at peace. Throughout the day, for an hour or half, set the alarm and delve into the subject of your choice. You can make your subject of your choice as the medium of your attention. Do this for minimum three months. If you want to change it, you may change the subject after three months. If you change it every weekly or monthly, the experience of meditation shall be delayed.

Schedule and time-bind these methods of meditation. And if possible, even the place. This will help you expedite the process as well as deepen it. To decide the timeframe means that daily at 7am and at 10am -- this is just an example. You may decide as per your convenience. Through these methods, the inner mind, calms, clears and stabilizes. This will provide you the ability to delve deep into important subjects and also shall widen your perspective in them.

Patanjali discusses the ability to think big - on the macro level, as well as think in detail - at the micro level at the same time. Any individual gains prosperity and success as per his ability to think. When the thought is limited or narrow, the person does not progress much. You would have seen many people around you who have a very limited or narrow thinking. Their way of life and their achievements in life are a direct result of their thinking. Sometimes, we are not able to control and we end up reprimanding them to think broader. But just by saying - it does not happen.

Patanjali says that it is very much possible do so through these methods. Knowingly or unknowingly, when an individual passes through these methods, then their vision starts getting broader. This is such an aspect of the mind, that starts to develop or can be developed. All those who have attained great heights in their lives - such heights that astonishes you - it is based on this aspect of the mind. Let us understand this with an example and then move ahead. Try observing a product with detail, for example a car, or a phone. Let us take an example of the car that is sold the most in the world.

Some set of engineers would have designed it, some set of workers would have made it in the factory, while the marketing would have been done by another team. But who made it possible for it to reach the entire world? The one who would be heading the project! For it is his vision that would have been spread to the entire world. The marketing team’s vision would be limited to one or two countries or maximum to a continent. The thinking of the workers would be limited to the factory, while the thinking of the car designer would be limited to the environment in which it has to be driven.

But the vision of the one who heads the project would include the engineer, the manufacturer, the marketing, government rules and regulations, banking, and the world market: it would include all. He is able to think on all the aspects more skillfully than all the other people involved as he is able to include all of them for an important and a huge task. The thought process of the person who is heading -- is macro as well as micro. Patanjali states that the head has a grasp over his mind, that helps him to take the product from small to big heights.

Patanjali, in this sutra, refers to the ability to see the details as well as the aerial view, or the ability to see things in totality.

When the thought whirls get emancipated - the weakening of modifications - the inner mind attains the clarity of a diamond. Being receptive, he receives, all that which is worth receiving. A complete balanced is achieved of these three states.

By practicing the methods as explained in the previous sutras, the mind attains clarity of a diamond. It is left without conflict or doubt. Hence it is never in dilemma, fear, confusion or a blocked state. It is free from these and is very receptive. The receptivity of the mind is increased. It just absorbs the relevant and leaves a lot of irrelevant behind.

Patanjali say that the balance of the three gives rise to the state of communion. With the clarity of the mind, it gets possible to know that what is it that you want in life. Close the book, and think for a while, about what is it that you want. What is your purpose or aim? What is your target in the next three to five years?

Make an effort. Close the book and start writing on paper. Then open the book and start to read ahead.

You will realize that you have a lot of clarity about the goals of the next 3-5 years. It is about this clarity and these achievements that Patanjali talks about in this Sutra. The clarity to see with, meditate with, and it will start internalizing in you, and you become receptive to whatever you feel suitable, to what gives you happiness and you start to achieve it too.
