_Yog Chitta Vritti Nirodah_

Yog is stopping the Whirls of repetitive thoughts in subconscious

After asking us to be prepared, Patanjali directly comes to the point. Though this sutra is just the second sutra, it holds the key, to the entire samadhi pad.

It says that Yog, union, is only possible, when one removes all kind of obstacles. all kind of disturbances, all kind of fluctuations from one’s mind.

Mind – what are the different states of mind?

Vyaasmuni beautifully describes mind beautifully in 5 states:

- Kshipta
- Mudha
- Vikshipta
- Ekagra
- Nirodah

Foremost comes the Kshipta mind. The mind which is not developed. It refers to all those, who are mentally incapable to understand and comprehend, leave alone the higher things of mind, but even the basic activities, they are not able to perform by themselves. Their brain is just not developed.

Then comes the Mudha mind. The dull mind, where the understanding and exposure is so limited. It’s like a frog, who thinks that the well he lives in, is the entire universe.

And then, comes the third kind of mind, the Vikshipta mind, the distracted mind, who is not able to concentrate and gets distracted easily. A mind like ours, yours and mine, where we are constantly browsing net for hours, looking for something, we don’t even know! Or where we spend hours window shopping and end up buying nothing!

Then comes the ekagra mind, the focussed mind. A mind which is able to focus – pay attention.

And then, in the end, comes the Nirodah mind, a mind which is controlled, regulated, a mind that is self driven.

So coming back to the understanding of this sutra, what is Yog? Yog is the control, the mastery, the regulation, the stilling, the quietening of the thought patterns of the mind. And this state of Nirodah is the goal of Yog. Yog will only happen, in a Nirodah state of mind, to a mind, where the whirls, the repeatative thought patterns, are in control.

Hence,

_Yog Chitt Vritti Nirodah_

Jab Chitt ki Vrittian control me hoti hai, Tab Yog ghattit hota hai.

Thank you.
