During the journey of Advance Course, I was given an opportunity to translate the Patanjali Yog Sutras, compiled by KB Sir, in English. With time, these sutras became an integral part of my life. Today, I attempt to share my understanding of them.

Yog sutras, formulated about 5000 years ago, are a practical guide to a happy and meaningful life. They guide us, step by step, on how to keep our minds free from fluctuations, so that we can focus on our goals and attain them with ease.

196 in number, they are divided into 4 chapters. I am sharing my understanding from chapter one onwards.

I would like to thank Sir once again, for placing his trust on me with the sutras and being a guide to me for their better understanding.
