Yog Sutra: Chapter 1.1 to 1.4

Yog means -- to stay within yourself.

Some thought patterns recur continuously in one's subconscious. For example, if you had an argument with someone during the day, then just before bedtime the entire sequence of events replays on your mind just like a movie. Even though you do not wish to think about it, these thoughts continuously surface in your mind. For example, thoughts like  “he should not have said this”, or “I should have said that”, or “I too tried to explain saying this”, or “why is he saying this?”, or “he should understand”, or “why is he unable to see” etc.

These recurring thoughts can start to play on your mind at anytime. They may play on your mind like a movie when you are brushing your teeth, or when you bathe, or when you are looking out of the window while driving, and at times when you are engrossed in work. If this flow of thoughts overwhelm you, you may not be able to continue to work. Most people tend to leave their work aside and get lost in these thoughts.

Patanjali says that only by subduing these thoughts, one is able to unite with the self, and that is the definition of Yog.

Only then is one able to stay within himself. He is united with the self. Until then, he tends to be like his recurring thoughts, where he is always lost in the flow of thoughts and loses his individuality.

The one who is able to see this -- you, the self -- is termed as the “observer” by Patanjali. Just like an observer watching a movie. While listening to melodious songs, an observer tends to substitute himself in the scenes, and starts to dance with the on-screen character. He does this in the cinema hall as well as outside the cinema hall! While watching a movie, a certain impression is formed in the mind of the observer. And when that tends to recur, the observer tends to identify with the movie characters and in doing so, loses his individuality. He becomes like his recurring thoughts.

You will find many a people around you who live the lives of the characters they see in movies. They live the movie character not only while dancing, but also in behaviour, speech, thoughts, and in action too. This makes them lose their identity, and they expect others to treat them as the character that they are living in their minds. When people around them are unaware of the movie impressions, and have not seen the movie, and their behaviour is not as per the expectation, it gives rise to a new set of problems and pains. 

At times when a person has lost his individuality, the methods of Yog can help one observe oneself, which in absence of a Yogic perspective would be difficult to observe. All achievements in life are possible only when one has identified with the self. When one fails to achieve the desired expectations in life, it indicates an absence of identifying with the self -- even if at a subtle level.

Further on, Patanjali discusses these subtle aspects. When you read about it, you realise that you live with these aspects several times a day. And to overcome them, Patanjali addresses the reason behind the continuous recurrence of thoughts, and then guides us with the techniques to stay within one’s self.
