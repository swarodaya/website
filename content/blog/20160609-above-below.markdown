Dennis W. Hauck translates the understanding of this cosmic law as, "That which is Below corresponds to that which is Above, and that which is Above corresponds to that which is Below, to accomplish the miracle of the One Thing."

Whatever happens on any one plane, whether physical, emotional, or mental, it also happens on every other plane. Everything in this universe is inter-connected, co-related, is in-synchronicity, in-alignment, and has very powerful influences and connections with us. This is the reason, our lives get influenced by the stars and planets in the heavens and by the directions and space on earth.

SwarYog, the ancient science of breath awareness is one such powerful medium that helps us explore and observe these universal connections and alignments. It helps us understand and co-relate everything that is happening within us to everything that is happening around us.

The occult sciences of Swaryog is beautifully aligned with Vastu. One of the many ways to explore the imbalances in a given space through the medium of Swaryog is interesting to understand.

Swaryog states that our breath is composed of 5 elements - space, air, fire, water, and earth.

When the flow of breath is directed from the outer sides of the base of the nostril, the Water element is predominant. When the flow is directed from the tip of the nose, the fire element is predominant. When the breath flows from the base, the earth element is active. When from the sides, where ladies wear the nose-ring, the air element is predominant and when it flows from the center at the base, the space element is predominant. This flow of elements in our breath is in a sequence. Starting with Space, then Air, followed by Fire, Earth and Water.

When we enter building, and observe at ease, we find a beautiful correlation between the imbalances of elements in that building with the elements of our own Swar. When an particular element in that building is disturbed or imbalanced, then that same element starts to predominantly flow in our breath, hinting us towards the imbalances in that particular place.

For example, after entering a building, if the fire element in your breath gets activated suddenly, (disturbing the natural sequence of elements), then it is an hint towards the imbalanced fire element that particular building. This can be interpreted as - fire imbalance.is the major cause for problems in that place, which when attended to, helps us settle a lot problems related to that place and its occupants.

When we lack something, our attention is directed towards it all the time. If we are hungry, we crave food. When thirsty, we crave water. In the same manner, our breath craves the element that is imbalanced in the space and hence, the body tries to compensate it by activating it (out of its natural rhythm order) through the medium of our breath.

Swaryog is a profound, deep and a beautiful science. Although, initially it may sound complex, it is not. However, it does require a systematic approach towards exploration of elements. Once the exploration of elements is attained, a lot more of connections can be gained in many aspects of life.

Alchemy is not merely changing lead into gold. It is a process of evolution and transformation that happens within us. As life takes us through various experiences, our soul is distilled and impurities are filtered. And the residue (the impressions or what we understand as Sanskar), that we are left with towards the end, is the true Alchemy.
