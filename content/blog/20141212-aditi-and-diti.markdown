In Hindu mythology, Aditi and Diti are referred to as the wives of Sage Kshayap and the daughters of legendary King Prajapati Dakhsa, son of Brahma. In vastu shastra, NorthEast encompasses the energy Diti and NNE encompasses the energy field of Aditi. Below, I have tried to summarize my understanding of these two mythical, powerful energy fields that exist right next to each other on the Mahavastu shakti-chakra.

### Aditi

In Sanskrit, Aditi means limitless, unbound, free, and unfettered.

The sacred energy field of Aditi has a guarding presence. It helps us develop solutions, and bails us out during trying times. When this energy field is disturbed, the occupants feel uneasy. It is very important for this energy zone to be intact, undisturbed and well-balanced, for the occupants to enjoy the benefits of a well-balanced life. This energy field is also responsible for providing the occupants with universal divine solutions.

Aditi is one of the important goddess of the Hindu pantheon and is also mentioned in the Vedas. The Vedic hymns frequently refer to her as the mother of gods. From her divine energy, all gods have emerged. She is the 'dev-mata' and her primary attribute is her motherhood. Sometimes, she is also associated with a cosmic cow, the one who provides and nourishes the entire universe. She provides security and stability. She is considered to be the feminine personification of Lord Brahma. She provides us with an unlimited power of expression and peace.

Her character has similarities with Greek mythology character Rhea -- the mother of six Olympians, and Gaia -- the goddess of Earth.

Legend has it that Sage Kashyap usually remained in a state of Samaddhi, while his wife Aditi spend her days in solitude while also taking care of the Sage. One day, when Sage Kashyap arose from his Samaddhi state, she expressed her grief to him. The Sage instructed her to undergo a strict and difficult-to-follow ritual. She completed the penance successfully as a result of which, she was blessed with a bright child -- the legendary Kapilmuni. Later, she mothered the 12 Adityas who are emblems of the sun for each month of the year, namely: Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Amsa, Duti, Indra, Savitra, Tvastr, Vishnu, Pusan, and Vivaswat.

Aditi means the one who is free and unbound, and hence these attributes challenge the orthodox values of a patriarchal society. When an entrance door is placed in this energy field, it results in prompting female members of the family to challenge the traditions of the family.

As novice ME's, we tend to look at the NE for issues related to one's mind. Although the energy field of Aditi does not lie in NE, but lies in NNE, it is as important as the zone of NE and should not be ignored. When the occupants find themselves disturbed, directionless, and lost, this is

one of the energy field to be examined.

### Diti

In Sanskrit, Diti means cutting, splitting, or dividing.

This energy field imparts freedom of thought, broad-mindedness and inner strength. It imparts clarity of thought and far-sightedness. When in balance, it provides ambition to an individual to accomplish their goals. It also imparts courage to say 'no', to disagree and disapprove, and not to blindly follow traditions. When this energy field is imbalanced, the occupants are confused and lose their ability to think clearly. They lose their ability to see different perspectives of a situation.

In mythology, Diti is Aditi's sister, and is considered to be an earth goddess and is said to be the mother of the Asurs. Seeing Aditi being blessed with children, Diti developed jealousy and a desire to have her own sons. Since Diti's mind was tainted by lust and hence impure, she gave birth to sons who disregarded ethics and followed a path of Adharma.

Legend has it that when Lord Shiv build the golden city of Lanka to reside with Parvati, its palace gates were placed in this energy field. Lord Shiv invited Ravan to conduct the auspicious vastu-pujan ceremony. In return of services, the cunning Ravana asked for the Lanka itself

as his dakshina! Hence, whenever an entrance is placed in this energy field, the members of the house gain wealth and enjoy a high bank balance, although, that wealth may not have been accumulated through ethical means.
