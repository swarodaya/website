_viparyayo mithya jnanam atadrupa pratistham_

Misinterpretations are based upon false perceptions

Viparya, comes from the word Paryaya, and the meaning of Paryaya is interpretation. Vi means contrary to. So one that is contrary to interpretation, can be understood as misinterpretation.

Patanjali says incorrect knowledge, lack of information, wrong or distorted perception, form the base to misinterpretations.

Coming back to our example of the boy meets a girl at the wedding.

> A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She smiles and at one of her cousins and the boy misinterprets that the girl is smiling at him and he feels that she is interested in him. It is his distorted sense of perception, that leads him to think in this manner. He goes and asks her, whether she loves him. She denies. He is heart broken. He is disturbed. He picks up a fight with her. He uses foul language and makes a scene. And even after doing all this, he cannot stop thinking about her. He is in pain. And the cause of his pain comes from the fact that he misinterpreted her gestures.

This is an example of how we often perceive a person or a situation or to be one way, and only to later discover that there was some missing element in our understanding, and this discovery changes our perception completely. And the problem with these misinterpretations are that they become the root cause of stress, ego, negativity and fear in our lives.

For example, if we are in a financially difficult position, and we are invited to a social event, we are hesitant to join. Our inner complexes make us feel, that because we are not financially doing well, our relatives may have us invited to show off their affluence. On the other hand, if we are doing financially well, and we are invited for a social event, our perceptions tell us, that because we are doing socially well, we are invited, or else no one would have bothered too call us!

And thatâ€™s why, the Talmud says:

> We do not see things the way they are, We see things the way we are!

It is our reflection that we seek in the society. And only if we are aware of our misperceptions, we shall be able to correct them, which in turn shall save us from negative, stressful situations.

Hence,

_viparyayo mithya jnanam atadrupa pratistham_

Misinterpretations are based upon considering false perceptions.

Thank you.
