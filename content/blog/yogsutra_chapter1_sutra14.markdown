_Sah tu dirgha kala nairantaira satkara asevitah dridha bhumih_

Persistent and continues practice, with devotion, establishes a firm foundation.

After explaining the importance of unbiased practice, for controlling the fluctuations of the mind, Patanjali states that continuous practice with effort and devotion, is the way to establishes a firm rooted foundation.

In his book Outliers, author Malcolm Gladwell, says that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. After studying the lives of extremely successful people to find out how they achieved succes, the psychologists found a direct relationship between hours of practice and achievement.

We know that Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. But many of us dont know that Gates and Allen had done thousands of hours of programming practice prior to the founding of Microsoft. The Beatles, for years, played eight hours per night, seven nights per week. The Beatles had played over 1,200 concerts together!

In plain words, Patanjali is asking us to fall in love with our interests and living it 24x7! People who are sucessful in any fied, are not always born gifted. But they are in love with what ever they are doing and live their subject all the time.

When we start living a subject, we see start seeing patterns in it. We start seeing clues everywhere and it seems that the entire universe comes to help us achieve our goal. We start seeing twists and turns in it that were hiding in plain sight. Those revaltions of the subject come to us, which were otherwise impossible to grasp. All this and much more. Everything else stops to matter.

And so the next time, when we see someone doing something, that we think is amazing, and get a feel that we are not able to it, stop for a moment, and ask, whether is that person doing something that we are not? And if we, too, want to do the same. are we putting enough of hard work? Are we in love with the subject? Are we living it 24x7? Has it become our passion, our obsession?

apne aap se puchiye, kya apme woh junnon hai?

Hence,
_sah tu dirgha kala nairantaira satkara asevitah dridha bhumih_

Persistent and continous practice, with devotion, establishes a firm foundation.

Thank you.
