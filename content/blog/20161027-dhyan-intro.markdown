Some events change the course of your life in a subtle, yet profound way. For me, one such event of life was being introduced to Patanjali Yog Sutras. During the preparation of the Advance Mahavastu course, KB sir entrusted me with the English translation of Patanjali Yog Sutras. Although it was a mammoth task and took a couple of months to translate, I enjoyed the journey. It helped me understand better the human mind and its workings.

Patanjali Yog Sutras are aphorisms by Sage Patanjali written circa 400 CE. They rank among the basic philosophical writings of yoga which talk about the methods of self realization.

The Yog Sutras are divided into four chapters, containing in all 196 aphorisms.

Chapter 1: Samadhi pada. In this chapter, Patanjali describes Yog and the ways to attain it.

Chapter 2: Sadhana Pada. In this chapter, Patanjali shares the instructions for the practice of Yog.

Chapter 3: Vibhuti Pada. Vibhuti is the Sanskrit word for "power" or "manifestation". This chapter is about the powers that can be acquired by the practice of yoga.

Chapter 4: Kaivalya Pada. Kaivalya translates to "being in Rhythm", which is the ultimate goal of yoga. This chapter describes the process of Kaivalya.

In a series of nine writings, I attempt to translate the book Dhyaan -- by sir -- which describes the first chapter, "Samadhi Pada" in depth. Through easy to understand examples and lucid flow of words, this book is recommended reading to all those who wish to understand the essence of Yog sutras. This book is available in Hindi. I share the English translation of the same. In my translations, I have attempted to maintain the essence as I have felt it.
