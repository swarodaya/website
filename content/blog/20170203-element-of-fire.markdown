What do you see? The Element of Fire.

There is a very famous incident from Mahabharata where Guru Drona is teaching his young disciples, and he asks the question, "What do you see?" They all give different answers to the same question. These answers reveal a lot about their own personalities and the ongoing thought process within.

Among the few who were asked this question were the young Duryodhana, Ashwathama, and Arjun.

Duryodhana, Arjun, and Ashwatthama - all three warriors - represent the element of fire present in an individual in three different states.

The story goes as follows -

"What do you see?" asked Guru Drona.

Duryodhana replied, "I see the bird and you!" Guru Drona smiled at the jealous young prince because he had sarcastically included the Guru himself as a possible target! He realized that Duryodhana's vision was covered by jealousy and envy. This would never allow him to see the truth with clarity. How could Duryodhana ever hit the target if his vision was clouded! "Put down your arrow and return to your place", said Guru Drona.

Then he called for Ashwathama, his son, who replied, "I see the bird." Guru Drona probed further, "What else do you see my son. It's eye?" Ashwathama replied, "I cannot see it's eye properly father!". "Put your weapon down son and go back to your place", replied Guru Drona. Ashwathama was saddened for failing his father once again.

Then came Arjun's turn, who replied, "I see the eye of the bird, and nothing else." Guru Drona gave a broad smile of satisfaction. Arjun aimed his arrow and successfully pierced the eye of the wooden bird.

The three answers expose the three states of Fire - Rajas, Sattva and Tamas - that are present in an individual (in terms of Breath, Space or Planets).

Duryodhana symbolizes the Rajasic Fire - the hyperactive form of fire. When the fire in an individual is hyper, it is reflected in his thoughts and behaviour. When Duryodhana said that he sees the bird as well as his Guru, he exposed the anger and aggression that lay in him. Duryodhana had hatred for the Pandavas and was upset with his Guru too, for he thought that the Guru was partial towards Arjun. This created feelings of anger and jealousy which ultimately resulted in the war of Mahabharata.

When the element of fire is hyper, we call it "extended" in terms of vastu zones, the residents suffer from aggression. Envy, jealousy, and rivalry are different ways that this aggression gets expressed by the residents in their thoughts and actions.

Ashwathama represents the Tamasic Fire. He represents the disturbed fire. Ashwathama was not being trained in weaponry to fight wars. He was being trained in weaponry to become an acharya like his father: not an archer. He never understood this difference and thought of it as discrimination. The thought of his father, regarding Arjun as being higher than him, highly disturbed him. After the entire episode, he burnt the tree as he was too upset with his father's love and appreciation for Arjun.

When emotions (water element) enter the domain of fire, the aggression of fire is suppressed and it finds its outlet in negative ways. Ashwathama's hatred is expressed in his cowardly acts that made his reputation suffer forever.

In terms of vastu, it can be understood as presence of anti-elements (especially water) in the zones of fire. And in such cases, residents suffer from defamation and charges are levied against them.

Arjun represents the balanced form of fire. His energy is channelized in the direction of achieving his target. The two incidents that gave him fame and build his reputation are: one, where he is able to target the eye of the bird and win the heart of his Guru; and second, where he (later in his life) targets the eye of the fish and win the hand of Draupadi. Both these incidents that made him famous in history are because he is able to achieve his targets.

When the fire zones are balanced in terms of vastu, the residents are focussed on their tasks and are able to meet their targets and establish their reputation.

The Bow and the Arrow, considered as a supreme weapon, is a symbol of poise and balance. It represents channelized fire.

There is fire present in all of us. When channelized, we become goal oriented. Our transformation in life depends on the our ability to harness and channelize this energy. An astrologer channelizes this energy by balancing planets, a Vastu consultant does this by balancing the zones, and a Swar yogi does it by balancing his Swar - the breath.
