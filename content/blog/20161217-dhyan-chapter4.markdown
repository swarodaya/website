Yog Sutra: Chapter 1.17 to 1.22

Wisdom through Self-Realization.

Along with self realisation comes a new thought -- new insight -- imparting a "wow" feel. It feels as if some knot in the mind has been untangled and the mind is lighter, clearer, and is filled with new thoughts. Patanjali defines this state of mind with a new term "Sampragyata" -- insight or inner wisdom. Many a times, people consider this to be a state of Samadhi. Although, it is not so. Patanjali understands this state based on his experiences of the initial states of Meditation. Even the one who does not meditate, would have experienced this state many a times. This state can be recreated by choice through regular meditation. Whenever one wishes, one can create it. And it is in this state of mind, that new avenues of success begin to open up.

Generally, while talking to someone about our ambitions or goals at a special place -- like a seashore or a golf ground, or while taking off in a flight, or while overlooking the sky from a tall building or a mountain, or while watching little children talking to each other -- a new thought --  or a new insight opens up a new path for you, and fills you with a new awareness. And, this experience is beyond logic - full of depth, blissful, and insight - that takes you beyond the experiences of the limitations of the mind. 

Let us understand the word "Pragya" -- enlightened consciousness, for Patanjali uses it regularly. This word is a combination of two roots. The prefix "pra" means the external or the one coming from outside, and "gya", means the knowing or knowledge. As the word "Prabhav", -- influence, can be understood as a "Bhav", emanating from "Par" or something or someone else. So, when we say that in the "Prabhav" of -- under the influence of -- it is an indication of an external emotion. When we say -- he is a "Pravasi", a tourist, we imply that he comes from another place.

This Pragya -- enlightened consciousness -- can be understood as awareness stemming from an "external" source -- which was absent previously. If it was present earlier, it would fall in the category of logic. But this is beyond Logic. If it arises from the depths, then it must be deep. If it touches the core, it is blissful. If it has risen from beyond the limitations of the conscious mind, then it would be making you aware of limitlessness of your mind.

As per the method explained above, by maintaining this state of awareness, one more state rises where only "Sanskar" (impressions) are left with.

In a very beautiful manner, Patanjali makes you aware of the different states of mind, and takes you to the deep states of awareness. In the sutra 1.16, maintenance of this state is indicated, and it does not indicate a pause. The maintenance of this state gives rise to a new state, in which not only sanskar (past impressions) are retained, but an awareness of the self is gained along with the feeling of being merged with Nature. It is a state of being absorbed into Nature; where the awareness of the physical body is lost.

By following the two methods given by Patanjali in the forthcoming sutras for twice a day, within the span of one week or ten days, different people experience this merging: an experience of being one with the great universe is felt. An experience that is felt in the depths of oceans or close to the waters. An awareness of water is present and a feel of weightlessness is experienced.

In the merging with Nature, and after losing the awareness of the physical body, one gets the experiences of the vastness.

Further on, Patanjali adds that through faith, enthusiasm, memory, absorption (samadhi), and wisdom, this state can be experienced. The method is explained in the forthcoming sutras. With intensity, reaching this state can be expedited. The pace of progress depends on the intensity of the effort made -- whether low, medium, or strong.
