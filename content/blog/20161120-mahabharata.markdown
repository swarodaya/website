Moments from Mahabharata: Garuda, Matali and Indra Dev (South-West).

Garuda was the king of birds. Matali was the charioteer to Indra Dev. One day, in a moment of arrogance, Garuda insisted on eating Sumukha -- the serpent, who was to be married to Matali's daughter. Matali begs Garuda not to do so. Yet, Garuda refuses to budge. Finally, Matali requests Indra to intervene. To humble Garuda, Indra gently places his hand on his back. So heavy was the weight of Indra's hand, that Garudaâ€™s movement gets restricted. His ego breaks. He apologizes and lets Sumukha go.

Let's us look at this story from the perspective of the Elements.

Garuda is symbolic of movement. It represents the Air element. By placing a Garuda in the South-West, (in the Pad Devta of Indra in South-West), we are requesting the space to impart us with the ability to grab opportunities. However, this remedy can only function if the Earth in South-West is supporting and is balanced. Keeping a Garuda in South-West, without balancing it will make an individual just an opportunity grabber without bringing in long term commitment to the end task.

Then the second thought arises, that if Garuda is Air element, how can it be allowed in South-West? When we study elements in totality, we understand that no element is completely pure in itself. Every element is a mix of other elements in minor proportions. Hence, throughout the home, we generally have placements of objects that are representative of different elements and yet, we don't face challenges. However imbalances only arise when an element other than the element of the zone comes into play in a major proportion. And to aid the process of balancing of the zone, the remedy of Garuda is made of the metal brass ( representative of element earth).

So, if the Earth zone is extended, the Garuda placed in South-West will still give results however though, the same Garuda will not be equally effective when the zone of South-West is cut or imbalanced.

Hence, only when the hand of Indra gets heavy, the movement of Garuda gets restricted and balanced. The presence of Earth channelizes the movement of Air. If the same hand is light, the movement will not give the desired end result. Residents will not be able to complete tasks responsibly if the remedy is placed without the balancing of the zone.

Mahabharata is that "treasure trove" that just keeps giving!

Best Wishes, Seema Karecha.
