Although sharing Advance Course contents is strictly prohibited, but after showing my write up on Siddhis and an urge to share the absolute wisdom nuggets, I got permission from KB sir to share it with ME family. It has been an pleasure hearing KB Sir comment on Patanjali during Advance Course. Through his interesting and contemporary analysis of the subject, he has brought life to the age old Yog Sutras and have made them very interesting and relevant for the common man of today's world.

In the below write up, I have attempted to sum the essence of the Ashta-Siddhis as explained by KB Sir during the advance course for Vastu Acharyas to give positive results.

Traditionally, Ashta-Siddhis, as mentioned in Patanjali Yog Sutras and later, in the popular Hanuman Chalisa, are said to be those supernatural powers that enable an individual to perform extra-ordinary feats along with Advanced MahaVastu Remedies.

He elaborated what are these Ashta-siddhis in reality and how can we attain and utilise them in today's world.

This write-up shares contemporary understanding on Siddhis as given by KB Sir. Each siddhi is explained in two parts: the traditional outlook and second, the contemporary outlook offered by him

### Ashta Siddhis:

Hinduism defines eight siddhis (Ashta Siddhi) or eight great magical powers as follows:

1. **Anima**: becoming infinitely small
2. **Mahima**: becoming infinitely large
3. **Garima**: becoming infinitely heavy
4. **Laghima**: becoming infinitely light
5. **Prapti**: ability to receive anything
6. **Prakamya**: ability to possess whatever one desires
7. **Istva**: possessing absolute lordship
8. **Vastva**: ability to influence masses

## Analysis:

### 1. ANIMA

**Traditional interpretation**:

The ability to become small in size is known as Anima Siddhi. By the power of this siddhi, an individual can reduce his body even to the size of an atom or even become invisible.

**Contemporary understanding**:

The mental faculty to get to the relevant point or the ability to grasp the essence of things.

The ability that allows an individual to get to the core of the matter, mastering it at micro level and express it minimum words effectively. It is a mental skill that can be developed over period of time with constant practice. Higher the awareness level of the individual, more effectively is he able to communicate their ideas using fewer words.

Patanjali, himself, explained the entire yoga-sutras in just 196 sentences! And each of these sentence is complete in itself. Not one word written in those sutras is extra or unnecessary.

### 2. MAHIMA

**Traditional interpretation**:

Mahima siddhi is the ability to expand one's body to an infinitely large size. By attaining this siddhi the practitioner is able to expand the size of their body to become larger than the universe.

**Contemporary understanding**:

The ability to expand a thought or an act on a bigger scale.It is the ability to expand a thought, business or a subject at global level. As thought of online search expanded by Google, getting Connected with Friends by FaceBook, chatting experience redefined by Whatsapp.

Another aspect of this siddhi is the ability to look into the big picture. It is the ability to visualize things or events in totality and on a much larger scale for larger growth of clients.

### 3. GARIMA

**Traditional interpretation**:

The ability to become infinitely heavy is known as Garmia siddhi. The practitioner can make themselves as heavy as they desire to be and cannot be moved by anyone or anything.

**Contemporary understanding**:

This is the ability that blesses individuals to have weight and depth in their thinking reflected by their words and actions. Individuals should have weight in their actions and words, that their authority and grasp on the subject is unshakable. There should be so much of depth that the act or deed itself becomes the highest standard in the subject.

For example, YogSutras of Patanjali for creating most powerful mind, Lord Krishna's Words in Geeta to define our righteous role in addressing everyday war of internal chaos and Leonardo da Vinci's Monalisa. These masterpieces have mesmerized people for decades, but also have become standards for various parameters of life and art for leaders and artists around the world.

### 4. LAGHIMA

**Traditional interpretation**:

The ability to become weightless or lighter than air is known as Laghima siddhi. This enables one to fly in the air.

**Contemporary understanding**:

This ability can be understood as the power to become light within so that whosoever comes in contact with you, consult or read your words feel light within. The ability to let go at such an extent that no one feels burdened in your company.

It is the ability to let go. Even when unfavorable or unexpected events occur, the individual is able to let go and lighten the atmosphere. 

In relationships, this ability enables individuals to forgive and forget without much fuss. In adverse situations, it enables us to let go of the damage done and move forward with future plans. Flying in air can be interpreted as keeping one on higher plane for getting an arial view of life to achieve greater growth.

### 5. PRAPTI

**Traditional interpretation**:

The ability to construct or achieve anything is known as Prapti siddhi. The practitioner can achieve anything he desires through this siddhi. For them, nothing is impossible, such as providing water in a desert.

**Contemporary understanding**:

The mental confidence or outlook in applying persistent effort to get things done. It is the ability to execute thoughts into action. The ability to do all that is needful to manifest the thought in the mind into concrete action and seeing it materialize. You just need to know right sequence of actions along with awareness of actions in right direction.

For example, if one decides to meet President Obama to convince him and sell him an idea. At first, such thoughts look impossible to a lay person's mind. A person who practices this ability would not ponder on the impossibility of the task, but will rather focus on the logistics to make it possible. He would not be discouraged with the impossibility of this thought. It's a never say die attitude to make things happen.

### 6. PRAKAAMYA

**Traditional interpretation**:

Prakamya Siddhi is the ability to become whatever the practitioner desires. By achieving this ability the practitioner is able to do anything he wants like flying in the sky or walking on the water.

**Contemporary understanding**:

It is the ability to fulfill desires by first knowing your core desires. The ability to expand one's expression beyond imaginable boundaries and capabilities overcoming limited mind sets and prenotions of limited thinking. For example, when someone starts a small shop at a road side corner and over a period of time goes to expand it into multiple five star hotels.

### 7. ISHITVA

**Traditional interpretation**:

Knowing all powers and getting a control over them is known as Ishita Siddhi. The practitioner is able to gain control on all the elements of universe and possess absolute lordship.

**Contemporary understanding**:

Ishitva is the power to create by contemplating on creative force of thoughts, emotions , objects , elements , skills and people as well. It makes us as a co-creater of things.

Examples of this Siddhis can be Steve Jobs, the creator of Apple or Bill Gates, the creator of Microsoft. Stalwarts like these have successfully created a world of products that were previously absent, with their brilliant foresight and skill.

### 8. VASHITVA

**Traditional interpretation**:

Vashitva is the ability to subjugate all. With the help of this siddhi, one can attain control over all kinds of living and non-living things.

**Contemporary understanding**:

The ability to attract people is Vashitva. The charm and the persona to attract attention influence people with it is Vashitva.

A good example of this ability is Prime minister Modi. Despite his humble beginnings as a tea seller on the railway station, he has been able to attract attention of the nation at large and has become a national leader. It is his charismatic personality derived from his yogic mind, that the entire nation has become his die-hard fan.

### Conclusion:

In ancient times, the mighty Kings were given the title of "Chakravarti": figuratively meaning the one universal sovereign who has the ability to get the wheels rolling, the one who can conquer one and all. The symbol of the Dharma chakra has 8 spokes. These 8 spokes can be understood as the Ashta-siddhis. If we are able to understand the significance of these Ashta-siddhis and attain them through practice, we become those universal beings, for whom nothing is impossible. Not only will we be able to succeed, but everything that we wish to desire shall be in our lives and in the lives of our clients, and help our clients become the Kings of their domains.
