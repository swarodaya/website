_Tada drashta Swaroope Avasthanam_

Then the observer, establishes in his own nature.

After asking us to be prepared for Yog, and explaining us, how to remove distractions, one is able to attain Yog. Patanjali, in this sutra, tells us, what will happen when one is able to take off distractions from one’s mind. He says that when we remove the distractions of the mind, we shall be able to establish in our own nature, our original form.

- Tada / then
- Drushtaa / observer
- Swaroopam / original form
- awastha / Shall be able to establish.
- Tabhi hum stapit ho sakte hain.

After the process of Nirodah, the true self stands alone, it is not a process of attaining something, it’s a process of eliminating some thing.

This brings us to the Sanskrit concept of Neti-Neti. Not this not that. This is the method of Vedic analysis of negation. The seeker is able to identify the true self, by negating, what is not the true self. You come cLose to your atma, by negating, what in anatma.

The word can be broken into n + eti. Not this, not that. Guru Granth has a very beautiful shloka (verse) on this.

_Na Shank, na chakram, na gaada, na seeyam_  
He doesn’t have any conch shells, nor any chakras, nor gaadas nor is he blue colored.

_Achraj Roopam, rahit janam_  
He has beautiful form and is beyond birth.


_Neti neti kathit ved_  
The Vedas says that he is not this, not that.

_Uch-mooch, apar govindam_  
He is high and the infinite.

_Basanti sadh hrudayam, achut bujati, Nanak badbhajya_  
If you want to seek him, he resides with you, and all those who are fortunate, says Nanak.

So, when we free our minds from minor and major fluctuations, we are able to rest in our own nature, our atman.

Hence,

_Tada drashta Swaroope Avasthanam_

Thank you.
