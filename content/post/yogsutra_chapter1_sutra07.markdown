_pratyaksa anumana agamah pramanani_

Reasons for being right are based upon seen experiences, interpretations and ancient scriptures. In the previous sutras, Patanjali lists the 5 reasons for the thought whirls. Pramana or right knowledge, being the foremost in the list.

In this sutra, Patanjali, states, that Pramana, the knowledge, can be attained from three sources: seen or direct experiences, interpretation and ancient scriptures.

We, as humans, base our decisions or opinions on our judgements. And our judgements are based on our experiences, on our understanding and on our reading of ancient books.

Pramana can be well understood with the example of a boy meets a girl. A boy meets a girl at the wedding. The girl looks at the boy and she tells him that she is in love with him and wants to get married. This event creates a series of thoughts whirls in the mind of the boy. This is case of Pramana, where the boy has a direct experience of meeting the girl and hearing her say that she loves him. She wants to get married to him. In this case, the event or the emotion is directly seen and perceived by the boy. And depending on the boy’s situation, it can be hurtful or not. This thought can be non-hurting, if the boy likes the girl. It would rather make him happy. But, just in case, he does not like her, or is in love with someone else, and he is in a situation that he cannot say no to her, it can be hurtful – however the event has created a situation where he is constantly thinking of what has happened. What he has directly saw and experienced, become the starting point to a continuous chain of thoughts.

What happens when one just understands a subject or a thought, has knowledge about it, but has no experiences, or validation? In such cases these individuals who are authorities on a subject, but have no practical experience of the same. It leads to memorization or mere intellectualization. Their understanding is not complete or mature.

I remember my experience with a famous gynecologist in my home town. When she started practicing, she was unmarried, young and did not have kids of her own. Her approach towards her patients was very indifferent and cold. However, later, when she got married and had kids of her own, her attitude changed dramatically. She became warm and compassionate. Our understanding of a subject, our perspective, undergoes a lot of change, when we ourselves live these experiences. When we walk the talk.

Hence,

_pratyaksa anumana agamah pramanani_

Reasons for being right are based upon seen experiences, interpretations and ancient scriptures.

Thank you.
