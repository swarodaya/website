_abhava pratyaya alambana vritti nidra_

Repetitive unawareness is based upon lack of exposure.

In this sutra, Patanjali states nindra as the fourth reason for hurtful or not hurtful thought whirls.

Nindra, our unawareness. Patanjali does not refer to it to sleep with closed eyes. He refers to that state of mind, that we live in 24x7, with our open eyes. It refers to a state, where, with open eyes, we are unable to see, observe or perceive!

Coming to our example of a boy meeting a girl:

> A boy meets a girl at the wedding. She looks at him, smiles. She starts a conversation with him and gives subtle suggestions about her interest in him. This boy however, is so full of himself, that he is totally unaware of the feelings, the girl is trying to communicate through her gestures. After the wedding is over, he realizes situation.. He realises what he had missed, as he he was unaware at that moment. But now, the moment has passed and itâ€™s too late. Although, now, he is cannot stop thinking about what had happened. His unawareness becomes the foundation to his non-stop thought whirls.

This story can have two endings. In future, if he gets a chance to meet the girl, and convey his thoughts, he shall be happy. But if he does not get this opportunity, he shall be depressed. In whichever case, he is unable to stop thinking of the event.

Awareness is the ability to perceive, to feel, or to be conscious of events, objects, thoughts, emotions, or sensory patterns. And the level of awareness is directly linked to our success.

"Expanded awareness brings success. Awareness isn't a rubber band, but it needs to be stretched", says Deepak Chopra.

And how do we stretch this band? How do we develop self awareness?

Patanjali says, only when we are able to stop our thought whirls, we are able to establish in our selves, and when we are able to establish in our selves, we are able to develop self awareness.

Hence,

_abhava pratyaya alambana vritti nidra_

Repetitive unawareness is based upon lack of exposure.

Thank you.
