Swaryog is a science where we unite with our breath to gain an understanding of the self and our universe. Swar or breath can be understood in terms of Nadis and Tatwas. When the breath flows from the left nostril, it is referred as the Chandra Swar and is associated with the Ida nadi of our body. When the breath flows from the right nostril, it is referred as the Surya Swar and is associated with the Pingala Nadi of our body.  When the breath flows from the both the nostrils, at once, it is referred as the Shunya Swar and is connected with the Sushumna nadi of our body. The breath, depending on the flow is associated with the different nadis, which in turn, has different effects on our mind and body.<br/><br/>To add to the effect of these nadis, is the dimension of 'tatwas' or elements. The place in the nostril through which the breath flows, is referred as the 'element' or 'tatwa' of the breath. There are five different elements (Space, Air, Fire, Earth, and Water) that can flow in a nostril at a given time.<br/><br/>This combined play of Nadis and Tatwas is the science of Swaryog. It not only helps you raise your awareness and, connect deeply within, and feel grounded and rooted, but also is of immense help in decision making, event planning, foreseeing events, creating abundance and prosperity.<br/><br/>During the session, students learn to recognize the Nadis, the Tatwas and understand their properties and usage  for their personal and professional use."
