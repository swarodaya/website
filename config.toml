            text = "<p>Swaryog is an ancient indian science of breath awareness that has been practiced by yogis, spiritual masters, and seers of India, since thousands of years, to create a life of prosperity and abundance.Swar is breath and yog is to unite. Swaryog is a science where we unite with our breath to gain an understanding of the self and our universe. Swar or breath can be understood in terms of Nadis and Tatwas. When the breath flows from the left nostril, it is referred as the Chandra Swar and is associated with the Ida nadi of our body. When the breath flows from the right nostril, it is referred as the Surya Swar and is associated with the Pingala Nadi of our body. When the breath flows from both nostrils, at once, it is referred as the Shunya Swar and is connected with the Sushumna nadi of our body. The breath, depending on the flow is associated with the different nadis, which in turn, has different effects on our mind and body. To add to the effect of these nadis, is the dimension of ‘tatwas’ or elements. The place in the nostril through which the breath flows, is referred to as the ‘element’ or ‘tatwa’ of the breath. There are five different elements (Space, Air, Fire, Earth, and Water) that can flow in a nostril at a given time. This combined play of Nadis and Tatwas is the science of Swaryog. It not only helps you raise your awareness and connect deeply within, and feel grounded and rooted, but also is of immense help in decision making, event planning, foreseeing events, creating abundance and prosperity. During the session, students learn to recognize the Nadis, the Tatwas and understand their properties and usage for their personal and professional use.<p> <br> The Swaryog session covers: <ul> <li> An in-depth understanding of the Nadis and Tatwas. This includes the Nadis and Tatwa identification, and their practical usage in terms of understanding your own mind and emotions based on your own Swar, working through your own challenges and gaining clarity, making major and minor life decisions and creating a contented life. <li> Swar Panchang - Planning events (wedding, meetings, interviews etc) based on the knowledge of Swar. <li> Association of Swar with other occult sciences like Astrology and Vastu."
