            text = "<p>Swaryog is an ancient indian science of breath awareness that has been practiced by yogis, spiritual masters, and seers of India, since thousands of years, to create a life of prosperity and abundance.<br/><br/> Swar is breath and yog is to unite. Swaryog is a science where we unite with our breath to gain an understanding of the self and our universe. Swar or breath can be understood in terms of Nadis and Tatwas. When the breath flows from the left nostril, it is referred as the Chandra Swar and is associated with the Ida nadi of our body. When the breath flows from the right nostril, it is referred as the Surya Swar and is associated with the Pingala Nadi of our body.  When the breath flows from the both the nostrils, at once, it is referred as the Shunya Swar and is connected with the Sushumna nadi of our body. The breath, depending on the flow is associated with the different nadis, which in turn, has different effects on our mind and body.<br/><br/>To add to the effect of these nadis, is the dimension of 'tatwas' or elements. The place in the nostril through which the breath flows, is referred as the 'element' or 'tatwa' of the breath. There are five different elements (Space, Air, Fire, Earth, and Water) that can flow in a nostril at a given time.<br/><br/>This combined play of Nadis and Tatwas is the science of Swaryog. It not only helps you raise your awareness and, connect deeply within, and feel grounded and rooted, but also is of immense help in decision making, event planning, foreseeing events, creating abundance and prosperity.<br/><br/>During the session, students learn to recognize the Nadis, the Tatwas and understand their properties and usage  for their personal and professional use."

The popular Ashtang Yog form the core of these Sutras. The aim of the Yog Sutras is to help an individual attain immense clarity about the self, life, people and situations, giving a framework and structure to daily living. It is a guide to raising potential to the maximum and living life to the fullest, maintaining calm and composure even in stressful situations. The Yog Sutras helps us identify, and then plug, our energy leakages on mental and physical level, helping us evolve, be efficient, better organized and gain inner strength.<br/><br/>During the course, Acharya Seema renders her understanding of these complex sutras in simple english and help the student grasp their crux and help make use of the understanding gained to simplify and enhance life."
